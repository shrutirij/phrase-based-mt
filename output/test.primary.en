when steve lopez , funny , going to los angeles times , one day , the streets in the center of going to los angeles went , he heard a wonderful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , somewhere , are homeless , on a violin playing , the only still two strings .
many of you 're going to the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , of this movie , with robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> than nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> studied and whose promising career tragically early through his paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel left the master , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of going to los angeles .
i 'm going to everybody , <unk> book to read or , the film to watch , so they 're not just the wonderful connected to understand that between those two men that is , but also , like the music that make it , and how they finally , the instrument was , if this pun allows this is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get one .
i met mr <unk> in the years in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of and got behind the stage to do to me to imagine .
he was in a very <unk> and <unk> tone of the yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about what the dodgers it 's ever in the from the world series of creating would . and that all for the <unk> passage of violin in the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later , i get an email , in the state that nathaniel , for <unk> , i was interesting .
i must , say that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that it all his life being .
as a result of it is now , especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages . that are sometimes , so , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , and this horror and the <unk> his own mind to a lot .
and in this is a <unk> found myself , nathaniel , when we do with our first started in the walt disney <unk> hall started . he had this misdirection flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke and it , how to anyone in their sleep poison and i want .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid to him lose might notice that he in one of the conditions , get could , and that i was to its relationship to a violin destroy could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and other exciting forms of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started -- so simple , to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed , that in <unk> eyes a full of years ago , i went .
it was , as if he under the impact of an invisible have said , a chemical reaction , of the catalyst my game .
<unk> <unk> anger transformed them , in understanding , in a steady curiosity and grace .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started , then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear that he 's not just a <unk> knowledge of music owned , but it with her as a tight personal relationship on there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that i would just from my colleagues in the philharmonic from going to los angeles , i know .
and he music playing and about music , talking , it turns out of this <unk> , confused man , because it 's still the streets of going to los angeles , there was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the master <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions and his imagination and creativity in a real aspire .
and so <unk> he finds its who 's being .
i realized that 's what is that the essence of art .
what this is the reason , why we 're going to do : so we do something that in all of us , in the inside of us is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually forms .
and the fact that expression of us all , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel of , that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of the music brought him back in a family of musicians , it 's mind that would be talent and realized , and it so .
and i 'm always again with nathaniel music , no matter whether in the walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me that , why i brought musicians and i am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope that they pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes known .
i just two loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a fish , <unk> good , it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> , sort of the highest standards of sustainability , seeing .
you could , so i feel about that , it to sell .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i 've done in an event , which might think about the toward the farm .
`` of course , '' i said .
here was a company , the ability to try to this incredible this problem for our chefs become . how do we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans pulled out how we forests <unk> beaten up .
it 's hard , the destruction , <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they 're collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so i will probably or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . and a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are required to you a pounds <unk> gets .
not very sustainable .
they’re also not very good .
so here was finally one company , i tried , it right .
i wanted them to support .
the day , the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` just about the facts , right to have you are famous for , so far out in the ocean as opposed to her the environment is n't stop messing around . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we are so far out that the waste of our fish , you will , not concentrated . ''
and then put it 's add , `` we are , really a world .
these <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she told her ? ''
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said . he put on .
and at that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , a moment ago , the event , don .
i said , don , what the example , are sustainable proteins ? ''
he said , he had her that 's not . he 'll and .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me , let 's answer , until i finally , senior fellow biologists to get on .
we call him , don .
`` don , '' i said , `` what kind of , are sustainable proteins ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers , the skin , <unk> , this day , <unk> and to forage data . ''
i said , `` how much , have consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , what 's sustainable that 's chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a break in the line and he said , `` there 's easy to a chicken on the world . ''
i <unk> me , from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> in fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear to god , the fish , sort of entertainment , grilled chicken kept .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , you , ever better to his fish , who are things , you the fish , you cut more love .
i 've got it first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist had been thinking about this fish , spoke .
you think that has kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing white color .
the chef had him <unk> .
, twice .
but it was still delicious .
who can be a fish that well taste and let me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy , it .
we call him miguel , actually means he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish do n't cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
it 's near the <unk> the river <unk> .
until the thing i was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on the film that , the wetlands .
they did that , it by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated , a result of sewers , and they urged water from the country , and out into the river .
now , they could n't do that was fine , not economically .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds in the oil , which for this place of birds are .
and so , in a spanish company with green bought that land .
what they 've done ?
they have the river in the water , and vice versa .
they have literally the lever <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> did they have the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that 's still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and anything that you 're <unk> channels and these density , lush march .
i was there , not too long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's a really incredible guy , three parts , charles darwin and a part , `` a crocodile to kiss . ''
okay ? there we were and she fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been on the way to my at , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's what he 's a rare <unk> out .
now it 's the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here , which he 's a pattern of design that gave him at the <unk> giraffe reminds us .
it turns out , that miguel of his career in the <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , and it to this is a <unk> become .
he said , `` fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm a subject for connection . ''
and then , it and plummets , more about the rare birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and , do n't let me wrong , this was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this <unk> piece here 's a fish that i was in the brink had .
so i put him in the event . i said , `` miguel , how is it that your fish and so well , they’re ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , young , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , it continues to me tell that it 's a rich system is that the fish food , what you in the wild food , you .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is it , what the fish , she feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
the moment of a farm heard of their animals are not an ?
later on day i went on this site , with miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so , to be extremely , '' different than any farm , on the best i ever been was , `` how much it , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> has to have .
and we bow on the corner and we provided , the most sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , literally pinker carpet and so far from the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to their bellies on the pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was a very disturbed .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year we were on this site 600,000 birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it is the largest and one of the private <unk> , europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going to its head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
ever pinker so the belly and more than the system . ''
okay , let us that has come . a farm , their animals are not an and a farm , their success of the health of being able to measure .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos of the first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the evaporated better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to fly it comes 240 miles to farm .
and every night fly it comes 240 miles back .
they do that because they are the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a journey of the penguins had published , so i used to miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly it comes 240 miles to the farm and fly , then 240 miles back on the evening ?
do it for the children ? ''
he looked at me , as if i just a song from whitney houston quoted .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved fish mentioned , delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i like they 're not <unk> . i like they 're not an astroturf manufacturer .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking almost never seen it .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> tried to have it has n't even after <unk> kept .
they did cute , and in the thing , as if you a by the ocean , dignity .
i mentioned that , miguel , and he nodded .
he said , `` the skin , it looks like a swam .
it 's the alchemy , until something in the body to entry into .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck . ''
and then put it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish do n't an . a farm , their success , it is the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , if he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> it , because the water , that through this farm , which is coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , which are rivers , that we tend to bring them , to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it spreading through the system , fighting , and this , it 's the waters clean , how it <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so , not just a farm , their animals are not an , not just a farm , their success of the health of being able to measure , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not only for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i guess it , and that they should also do , because these year-old , like this was also always , is also telling .
you might argue that it 's a recipe is the future of good food , whether we kind of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , and taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future of good food can assure that somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love pink flamingos , but how you going to feed the world ?
how you going to feed the world ? ''
may i have to be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today josette .
one billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because it 's the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of this .
grows grain of <unk> , <unk> , monocultures , chemicals in the earth , grilled chicken , fish , and the sort of the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we are more people who do you feed , how awful it 's being ? ''

we should they call , what it is , a formed in <unk> , if you really , that fast , who end of its , and that these production of the technologies .
this is not formed , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> today is threatened , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , it by fertile one country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by a chainsaw , it by forests , and not by were doing and nets , it by the fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let it 's start with the question : how are we feed itself ?
or better , how we can conditions do that every community to enable themselves , to feed ?
to bring that do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry , and machines are at <unk> and it has never something really good for food produced .
we look , the ecological model .

you look , miguel , farmers like miguel ,
facilities , not worlds for , are , businesses , where instead of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> grow rather than just hard to farmers , not only emitters are , but experts for connection ,
because they are the ones who also experts to flavor .
and when i really quite frankly , i 'm sure you 're a better at us as i do it ever be going .
you know , that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it 's delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one thing with me make it is that the totality of the data that we consume , it as the sum of bits and instead to <unk> to think i want to that you think about how we information that can use that , well let me up and we actually realize that otherwise would n't have been visible to be like .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the age of these .
this program that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i want to a certain death filter it , we say crashes .
and immediately , i see a different patterns that , it .
and that is , because in <unk> here in the people at the <unk> are and it over here at the <unk> .
we can one step further out and out , the data and new , and see that <unk> and cancer , the usual suspects are , but not for everyone .
so if we go and after the age number , we say , 40 years or younger , we see that accidents , even the cause is about the , the people are going to start thinking .
and who <unk> see that is , especially for men in true .
you see so that 's look of information and data in this way , very , swim in a living <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can make , why not , the content itself ?
what we now have here are the front covers every single , `` sport <unk> '' that ever printed .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
it can do after my talk , in their rooms test .
with <unk> can you have them in a decade .
you can have them in a particular year .
you can go directly to a certain edition jump .
now if i 'm here at night , i see the athletes , in this edition appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i click go into , all tell me to show in which lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> track of getting to be that i think , `` ok , what if i do anything with the subject introduced by looking at you ? ''
so i walk a step back and <unk> of view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an example of that if you see this information scans , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way , and the way as information can be .
i think about this idea now a little out on with about what a little crazy .
so here we 've done is , we have every single <unk> and they 're going on a little summary reduced .
the summary contains a quick lost in and a symbol of the area of it comes .
i 'm just for the top 500 in the popular <unk> .
but even in this appears view , we can get lots of things do .
immediately , we have an idea of the themes that focuses on wikipedia , the popular .
so i 'm the issue <unk> ' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' who have you know what i want to the <unk> that , the most people , so , `` time magazine , `` people in the year , '' are .
this is really important , because this is an insight is that 's not in a single <unk> is .
it 's just to see if you one step back and the whole thing about it .
overlooking on a certain kind of <unk> can i then in the theme of time magazine , `` people in the year , '' in to go , and all together .
now if i had all these people consider you know what i want to the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , less , come from the economy . it 's my head . and a comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now jump , and a view on all the ted prize winner .
you see , we 're getting on the web , the first time as if it also really a net is , not just by side to side , but as much more abstract .
and so i want to you what else to show what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i think about it 's not a browser call ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .

that 's why most important , because you just through that look at the web in the kind of the way , all the <unk> on the same way , and the way at it .
so i can not in my -- that 's zoom in a certain time .
here is the entire demonstration , i went to go on this .
and i can kind of all , what 's what i 've been looking at what you have to go back .
and , when i went back one step <unk> and on all look , can i mean that 's new way , perhaps , my <unk> . here , i 've been , <unk> ' `` for , here , `` bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and of this is , i 'm going to the side inside and they went back up .
it 's a metaphor , and tried to use it will , and every time , it makes this picture than the sum of the data .
the moment in the world , we think that 's a curse .
we talk from the cursing the <unk> .
we 're talking about the `` drowning in information . ''
what if we do this situation around you could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , one of the other to go to start by many things to many things go to , and it creates pattern of see , which is this actually has never be ?
if we do this can , is this record <unk> , maybe a new source more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we can do it to get .
and if we know about , then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in me sitting , voracious curiosity satisfied .
these curiosity that , that i always , when i 'm not at school was , through the forests <unk> , around and `` samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , everything , looking at home and warm and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the limits of explore .
and my love to science fiction seemed , in my picture , since then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and they were exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing shows that we animals and places and a whole world of wonder showed that we 'd never looked like you can imagine .
that , then , very good at the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither video games , these <unk> with computer-generated movies , the imagery in the media , i had to the images in my head .
that we had at all . if we as children 's a book to read , we took the description of the author and projected them in the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the drawing and painting by aliens , alien worlds , robots , the spacecrafts , and all that .

the creativity had , somehow get out .
and i was something interesting . what i can find is , jacques <unk> shows the picture , was the idea of us to be completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spaceship achieve . it seemed to me very much .
but here was a world , i actually ever been able to see here on earth , and it was also fascinating and exotic as all that , what i always imagined was , when i think of these books had read .
so i decided , when i was 15 , scuba divers .
the only problem that was that i was in a small village in canada , living , one over 12,000 miles from the ocean away .
it was that i said , but not <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he finally , a <unk> in the shittiest , new york , down -- they did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter in the shittiest , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i was only two years later to face , when we call to california moved .
since , in the 40 years , now <unk> are , i spent about three , for an underwater spent . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is , how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature 's no borders , very , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to this , the days to me and then the awe for that , what i have on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity as they said , and ever .
when i then as adults , a profession <unk> , it was that <unk> .
it seemed to the best way of my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to be together .
as a child would i always comic books and so .
so we were films , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , was the stories that i <unk> , leaving science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> together .
so the case , sort of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had of like this liquid <unk> creating -- , <unk> we 're going on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what that came out , was the first computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see .
and the film , and it 's no money , just said , and he just over time , by a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience around the world was like mesmerized by the magic , it was writing .
according to arthur clarke 's law . you know , <unk> technology and the magic does n't even more people have to tell them .
it was so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow , it has to do in the immersion be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , much more .
together with <unk> created , we 're there , the guy of liquid metal . the success hanging , for one , like this effect arrive at it .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have to the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity for <unk> .
so i was a company , along with my good friend stan winston , to speak at the best <unk> and <unk> . it was `` digitally <unk> . ''

that we do then , and wildlife that a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s , what we now , but that we 're in <unk> and <unk> -- what we want the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` avatar . '' he wrote that the main <unk> in terms of visual effects , and <unk> effects , new heights say it should , with realistic human , expressive characters , using <unk> there were . and the <unk> should all <unk> . and the world to <unk> .
but the <unk> put stuff , and the people in my company told me that we <unk> still not in the ability to be , this one of law .
so shifted to the and made this other movie about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> , i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> epic <unk> , a film .
in ways , but i wanted to actually , real up at the titanic ourselves .
so i have the movie .
this is the truth . that we knew that , but not .
i have it , but i believe , and i said , `` we come to the cover up . we filming the actual up .
we 're going to make it in the <unk> the film us .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> for marketing . ''
and i <unk> them , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that , that your own imagination a reality to do it .
we then created in fact , six months later , a reality , in the time i 'm in russian <unk> end , four kilometers from the surface of the atlantic , and me the real titanic through a <unk> at .
that was not a movie , not a high definition , that was real .
so , this really amazes me away .
and the preparation for that were enormous . we had cameras , and strange and all sorts of building .
and i fell on the very these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend in the capsule , it down , you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope , saving is , if you see it does n't even back to do .
and i said , `` wow , that 's just as well , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was , obsessed with the study the deep ocean .
anyway , the future of this that with curiosity and science to do . it was it . it was an adventure , it was curious . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that 's made me to hollywood to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a being able to do for that we then a visual effect which could . but i could n't tell me that we can imagine what to the trappings of a window would see .
some , the following expeditions , i was being in <unk> seen , and things that i still never seen before , sometimes , things that actually , nobody ever seen before , and for that science to the time , when we do you saw , actually , no words that he had found .
that , i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met , then a particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i tell me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood on the ice , and i 'm going to a while <unk> . ''
and then we started , we came up , `` <unk> , '' and they were exploring with <unk> .
we returned to cover up the titanic back .
we took a little robot that we built , that have a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , the inside the ship to watch , what you 've never did was on .
nobody had ever , the inside <unk> demands . you 'd still not for another . so we evolved the necessary technology .
well , and there are the seats , i mean , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> that these <unk> here 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band , there was playing .
and i fly with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i do if it is just really , but my mind is within the <unk> .
it felt , as if i exercise within the <unk> on the titanic , and there .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> , i 've ever experienced this . because before i each of them to a corner on , i 've always been , what you in the <unk> the <unk> up to be given that i conducted months of <unk> did was , when we had the movie on .
this is set of it is an exact replica of the plans , the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
they made me this <unk> that what you have such <unk> avatars and use and so that your consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence embarrassed .
it was incredibly profound
and maybe a brief on this , what might be in a few decades might happen , if you <unk> , we do to explore or other things to do , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , i told me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we 're going down there had seen , really appreciate , to learn , for instance , these <unk> , where we have this incredible explains how they saw . that are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
they 're not in a on the sunlight , where we system , how we do this .
and so you see animals , the next to a 500 degrees c , this is they survive there .
the same time was interesting thing that i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .

that was amazing .
but the end , it was that out to deliver <unk> with us in the deep into this .
i took them , and <unk> them to the world upside down there : <unk> , <unk> , people that , for such extreme conditions were . i took them to the sources , so , you look around , so , and instruments test could and so forth .
we turned on a documentary films , the time , but actually science , more specifically , <unk> .
so you find them , the circle between my existence as <unk> , then , as a kid , and of those in the reality .
in the course , there , as i have a lot of them .
i have a lot of science learned . but now i think they certainly , a director and also has to lead to a leader , like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i think of these expeditions <unk> .
because of a particular point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do it ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking films bring us , no money .
we play , just the by a . of fame , a lane .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd let me to some of nails on one towel on the <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no glory , not an honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task will to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there 's . you 're doing it 's the <unk> because , and because of funny connection that is , if a small group of people have a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did that many years , 24/7 working . sometimes we were to two , three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that their is that you , each other , because you a task . that you any other things can explain .
if you look at the country that , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and the very precise idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on the lake works , '' then you do that other just do n't explain . this is the police or in the soldiers , something together we have gone through and you know that it 's never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , each other respect .
when i 'm so back to my next film `` avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same attends to run , which is that you may be a team respected , in return to respect deserves .
it was the dynamic really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on the unknown terrain . we did that , `` avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to a real family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people that said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and on the pandora transport them .
for me , it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of close ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at the first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality to do it .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , say , they give me a advice , like that can do . ''
and i 'm saying , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that could have another for you . i do n't it to myself , she 'll do n't want to themselves . but to take risks , you . ''
the nasa has this is a <unk> : `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail as an alternative , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for at that was ever without risk being addressed .
you must be ready , these risks on to take .
that 's the idea , i like to do with the true to leave . failure is quite an alternative , fear , but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and the surprise , maybe something that , because my <unk> in the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is about the things that we make them , and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life to get there .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years to do n't grow . it , we need to a lot sooner or to get out of rain . the things are , so , how it their fragile environment is not withstand can .
and that <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for them .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact that is that , what if it from one , the price down , you know , to <unk> would energy in exactly the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive in the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century . there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators , heavy , we can modern materials to make and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we put the price down -- we let us the price in case -- we meet on a barrier and this barrier to do with carbon together .
co2 fed up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually very clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the indirect the result , that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not able to and so a whole systems to come together .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the front of the centrality <unk> and where the other consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about , how bad those consequences . but they are extremely unhappy being !
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we need to really down to close to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is : it to be near zero to come to the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a fully three feet high truck , in three feet a bridge from . and then you can basically , and down .
this must be very , down , zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
the average are there 's about five million tons for every on the planet .
and somehow we need to change that it on a zero cost down .
it 's far as up .
just different economic transformations have it 's actually affects and we have to come from <unk> rise to reduction , and to a reduction , zero .
that equation , four factors . a little multiplication . they have this thing left -- carbon dioxide -- that they 're moving towards zero to break , and this is from the number of people on , the service , every person in the average uses , the average energy for every human services and the co2 , that per unit of energy <unk> will .
you make us so every single factor of them and look carefully , we , how we do it on the next to get .
probably have to one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we take it 's go through .
first , we have the population .
now live 6.8 billion people .
and it is on 9 billion . that , nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could this as well , to 10 percent to 15 percent down , but the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services , we use .
that includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> means , those services , almost every on the planet accessible to .
it 's amazing that number up .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we would probably <unk> make and less use , but the average is that number of every year up , so collectively , more than double , as well , services , the per person being put them .
here we see a very basic services . there 's home , and light , so you the homework can read ?
and these students have n't it , so what they go out and reading your schoolwork under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of different successes in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of those services , let me , to 90 percent to reduce .
in other service , like the making of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the scope for improvement is very much .
in general , if we make these are , we may be a reduction in a factor of the three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons gone . and that does not simply from !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a in his -- this is the amount of co2 , the per unit of energy <unk> will .
it turns , the question , if you on the next to get it .
if you coal burn : no .
if you gas will burn : no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> today , co2 , except that renewables , and maybe .
so , what we were on a global level to do , is , a new paradigm of law .
we need <unk> .
if i now the term `` wonders , '' i use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
and the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people have here to the development of wonder contributed .
usually , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain date needs .
typically looking at that you basically just wrong and some people come to do n't .
in this case , we must , but you floor , and give a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration of the idea of people here with ?
i think back at last year , when i mosquitos to somehow , they liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know that , people there , with these life .
for energy , i noticed that 's a .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies my <unk> contribution to the environment , this would be .
here are so a couple of natural fireflies .
you have to me , that that they do n't bite . in fact , they will probably not the time that glass of .
now , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they get all not much .
we need solutions , either one or a couple of an incredible this scale and how incredible dependability . and although it 's many ways , there , in that people who do , we find yourself , i really just five , these big demands can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and biofuels out .
these afford to be a ; contributions and if you better to do when i expect to be the great , but i mean that 's here is that we 're looking at all those five to work , and we can not a lot of you give up , because it 's imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or gas .
what you there are going to , it seems to be easy , but that 's not . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the and comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then somewhere between them , and to think it 's there 's left .
there 's some well , this is on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult to be . and a way that for the storage of co2 to achieve that 's a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who 's going to ensure that ?
who can do something you need to literally many billions of times bigger than any kind of garbage , the play , from <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .

the next thing : maybe .
the also has three big problems . the cost , in <unk> countries are high . the question , for sure that you 're really feel that nothing wrong , you can walk , despite the human organization that the fuel not for weapons that 's going .
and what do you then with the garbage ?
because even though he did n't it 's very large , there 's lots of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable are , and , where you to work was .
the last three of five , i 've summarized .
it are those renewables , often be called .
and also that have -- although it is that they do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
one thing , is the <unk> that these are going to create dramatic lower than the kind of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk about by many <unk> , 1,000 times more land area as a normal power .

the sun is not the whole day , it seems , not every day and much blows , the wind and not the time .
so you , you kind of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way to have to the energy , in times when they 're not available to me to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we like , say that the power of the country is , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the way to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , there are , at , the work for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of an energy , which the world is , comparing . i found out that all the batteries , we 're going to produce , less than 10 minutes of the maintains them , you could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of 100 times better will be , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that .
it 's happening , you 're trying to these <unk> sources , we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of which is to earth .
if you to 100 percent of it up trying to , you have an incredible with .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we can come to the goal ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds of .
in every one of five areas we need at least 100 people .
in many , you will say , that are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's a lot of that , there 's been engaged .
bill that has multiple companies , one of a woman named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do , and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; repetitive , liquid .
the development , in this industry , some time to end , so it 's no big surprise that some good , lying .
that <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent and burn , that <unk> .
that 's a crazy idea .
but actually did you about a long time thinking , but you could never as to simulate , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer there , you 're and see that : yeah ! with the right <unk> , it looks like this from that 's <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning to the garbage , and you can even the waste of what we could put them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . one thing .
that uranium dioxide is too uses , a little bit like a candle .
you see that 's a kind of pillar is , as a `` traveling wave reactor '' by .
that will actually the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the kinds of this that today , you will , <unk> so it says <unk> uranium .
the reverse the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's a sample of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we said , how we do our success measure to engage .
how to our testament to look like ?
now , we go to the goal , that we have to and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction until 2050 .
it 's very important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and always say , agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement until then clean .
so , these 80 percent to reach , to the developed world , including countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note , whether we have the <unk> technology can use these organizations , in all the developed countries in this is , and we 're going on the way that are , you to the rest of me to get .
that 's important .
this is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there could go back to be that by 2020 testament to look like ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the on the way to earth . i ever , we <unk> , more and this is the <unk> , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we can do that do n't completely to the big <unk> lead , just in fact , or in fact that matter less as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for those breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs , we do with the floor track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this topic .
that al gore book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> , `` <unk> energy <unk> the all about the air . ''
you take it really , and create a frame , of on this broad range of can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a request .
a very specific desire to this technology making .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to choose , a vaccine , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 is being invented . this desire to take me .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get there to the digging between the long and the short , we are people , terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
what we need to do ?
for which means for <unk> me ?
we need to for more context of those .
if countries , in places like <unk> meeting , they should not only about the co2 .
they should those <unk> discuss and they were shocked by the sounds ridiculous , low money , for those innovative approaches one .

we need to spread the message .
we need to dialogue was being and the entire lead and also the things that the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you can of us an idea of the scale that investment , there ?
bill gates : the simulation on a supercomputer to do , all of scientists to get , what we 've done , we need just some 10 million . and even if we have our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that it as to work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the tough step is that build the first vessel , another billion to find , the <unk> and the place of fact , the first of them .
once the first time . it is , when he said that 's like i promised , everything is very clearly , because the sense , the <unk> is so different than , maybe , how we know it .
the right to understand : that means a deep in the ground to almost like a vertical pillar nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting to the process , up and works , on up to the bottom ?
bg : right . now you have to the reactor , to turn into , so there 's many people and lots of control is that go wrong . this thing where you know it opens and stuff influences , or are going . that 's not good !
if you know , but very cheap fuel , the fudge factor for 60 years into -- you think of a pillar -- that they bury , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes for 60 years , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage offers .
bg : yeah . right , what do with the garbage happens : you can see him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less garbage with this method -- then take it and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by going to the garbage , the already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors run a problem was that , what we 're in our fill and so that will be <unk> dramatically reduce during this process .
but while you with different people , this world of opportunities that we 've talked ,
where it 's the interest , so what really doing ?
bg : well , we 've still not on a place so , and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there 's big interest and the people in the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister and i 've talked about , how this is to <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , and the french and the japanese have something in the direction .
this is a nuance of thing that 's been done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a little faster reactor and some countries have these are built , why is everybody , a rapid reactor implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in their idea : the time frame and the probability that really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that you 're very affordable , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the deadline , the <unk> demonstrated , that we all kinds of the center .
and , you know , <unk> , if all walks , and that 's a desire , it could easily .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of us , as well , when their approaches to work , the funding for your pilots works , for <unk> can .
and it would be the , if they are creating , since then you could be a mixture of you .
anyway , we need a solution .
about the big one of breakthroughs , this is the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> like this is announcing .
that it would also without the <unk> historically , but that makes it 's still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another innovative companies .
you know , we know the work , not as well , like this , but there 's the up a way that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to like , but you might say that 's about us .
and so there 's different , but the beauty in this is that a great <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , we say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems can get around and that are mainly in the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , he plays the potential , so the impact on the country , and other things , in a very own league .
if that does n't , what ?
we need to <unk> come to try to the <unk> stable enough to do ?
bg : if you in this situation , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and just a heart attack . what do you then ? you might be an <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> that , <unk> calls that , with various techniques into the warming to delay , to 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> .
you for is , that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't just kind of the insurance work , because one that might be lazy power , so you to eat , because you know that one of <unk> save will .
i do n't know if that 's smart , is , if you , the importance of this problem , and leads , but there 's now one discourse in <unk> about , if you know that was available to have to , if the things more quickly come , this innovation , no longer need , when we expect .
climate change , you have a or two sentences for the war , you might want to persuade ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different bully .
the ones who scientific are doing , are very little .
they say that , negative effects , there , with the clouds to have to the things here ?
there 's very , very few things that they do need to say , which it 's a chance in a million there .
that <unk> here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds of compiled all problems , in something to invest in that you only later , which has -- and this is that the investment is not that 's clear . in fact is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario , and there 's people in the rich world that , the ipcc look , and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact that is that uncertainty of us to make you should do .
but my dream is that , if you see it as economically from it , and at the co2 cleaned up , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't let me that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost that , i did that , but i 'm going to it has to accept , because it 's cheaper than the way this method . ''
and that would your answer on the <unk> scientist argument that , if you all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals , and suffering , the <unk> , what all of malaria and so that 's a stupid waste of resources , is , money to invest , while it better things that there , we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , you spend when they 're doing today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things do n't suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and here to make reasonable people on , if you something , that does n't have economic is , and trying to this to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it 's because , you is very quickly with a <unk> and financed only still the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich up .
i mean , of us here i could take five times as much for our energy on without your lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even scientist in its head .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , not more step up ? ''
he will still , because of his previous stories , <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very rare group is , and so it 's now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , i mean for them to think .
the research , it 's crazy , how little bit of which is .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that you wish that 's going . you very , thanks .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> to the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , i think about . <unk> tape , i think about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow building .
the marshmallow must on top .
and , though it really just like , it 's actually really hard , because it 's people who is very quickly work together .
and so i thought that it 's an interesting idea is , and i do it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops worldwide who did , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something at this task , what 's some insights in the nature of cooperation across the technologies and i want to some of them to share with you .
usually on the most people , in the task to orient .
you talk about , you go to look like it will look , they squeak to go ,
then on them a little time in planning and organization . it out and put <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the to build the urban structures ,
and finally , just before they were no time , you have to take someone in the marshmallow and they put him gently on the top , just one step back and `` <unk> ! '' admire them their work .
what , but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of the marshmallow does that the whole thing , how you and <unk> .
there 's a series of people that much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and the worst are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also on the very much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> , and the best are totally fresh alumni of this kindergarten .
and this is quite astonishing .
like us , peter was to make it 's not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might wonder , is : how is that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter telling : `` none of kids spent time it was the <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still one another reason .
and that is that mba trained by , a real plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
now what happens when you the marshmallow on the top of profanity , they have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> way to do this is that they do with the marshmallow start and prototypes to build a successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so that you can see the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of the collaboration as a core of <unk> are about .
and with every attempt to get the children are directly feedback , what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , with prototypes to work , essentially , we see again , how other teams to operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> , mba students to create a half of the lawyers something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most ?
and architects and engineers , luckily , .
<unk> is the , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they triangles began to understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
and ceo of something about the average . but here 's interesting .
it 's a will administrator on the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , and see , `` this team will win . ''
they can take the predictions . why does it ?
because they send out of the <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and that team that <unk> and on a structure of attention to the performance of the team , and dramatically improve .
propagated skills and <unk> and the combination lead to success .
if you 10 teams have to the typical approach , you ca n't . six , stable structures .
i tried to ask , something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the <unk> the same .
so she offered to a $ 10,000 dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think it happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high construction and have , he had the price , looking at home worn .
so it 's not interesting is that high <unk> a strong effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think this happening now ?
well understood it the advantage of the `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , bad team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of the incentive and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact , invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to teams to help , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is , it helps them hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . ethos , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of you that 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that , which actually a <unk> sports .
it is that we all our senses on the task to feelings and that we think that can use , like our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to earth .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
and a machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room to skeletal muscle .
and they do in the past , go , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here , and remain ,
and i wonder , what they 're going to be , because i was my friends in a lot lately asked this question , to have , and they all in the past , go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time back , before it 's car , or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're sort of the nostalgia , and wishful thinking , with .
and that i do .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i 'm not in the past , and that 's not , because i was a explorers i am .
it 's because that are on this planet is n't go back , you go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future , go .
this is the greatest time , it ever on this planet , whatever , which the scale , which is : health , wealth , and mobility , the opportunities , declining <unk> .
there 's ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died of when they had 60 were .
my grandparents urged that number on 70 percent .
my parents are the 80 on the into iraq .
there was so much better , a nine , my <unk> .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in new born will be able to find that long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
you think about their own . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . that smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth on a new shaped , how it 's no war ever done .
they 've gone . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . they shut down .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened to have , there 's still .
<unk> , <unk> , polio ...
i know all , somebody , what it is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that are successes of the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , things out , look , if it works , it , if it 's not going to one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's already there is the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned ,
and one of this is that despite all of our in a billion people in the world every day when i 'm going to go down .
this number up , and they are rising very quickly , and this is to do .
and that , we have our imagination used to the world that we had to your choice .
water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , which is pretty soon , and if we 're not because of chaos <unk> disappearing , we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people are going , without the country , they live , to rape her .
i think , we can take this world with energy to power that they do n't look at destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is sent me at night , wake up -- one of the things that i was at night awake . we 've been progress , it 's never really needed like now , never ,
and we were also , never , you 've been able to him about <unk> , we do it today .
we 're at the threshold to see , amazing events on many places . and so , but i think that you want to be hundreds of 300 years ago , i go back to to a time to find , in the time we progress , so there have , in the way we think about these things <unk> <unk> have to with more found myself as now .
the people were putting , in their believe , which is so closely , that you have n't release .
it 's the truth will they free .
and they stop , everybody has a fairly on their opinion , ; even a fairly on their opinion , to the progress ,
but you know , where they 're not quite have ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it took the figure out .
in about a decade , i was a piece of vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to run into the resistance to the , what the end of the most effective activity in health in history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did it 's what i always do , i wrote a paper and i went on .
and soon after that i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were nuts .
so i also about an article written , and i could n't understand why the people thought that would , `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain kind of a random jumble of move a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we have to type , we 're rich , we go to eat , that 's okay .
but these articles made me about , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and that 's because it is that those <unk> , to me nuts were doing it does n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me that 's not ...
but then i thought , you know what , we 're honest .
we 're on a point where , that we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , how early .
we 're talking <unk> of them .
we 're talking ironic that , with a little quotes about : `` progress . ''
okay , that there 's the reasons , and i think we know , which is a reason that are .
we have the faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not that should be .
you can just a couple of names call and the people to understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can maintain their own list vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , which we believed that they always right to have happened . let 's so they 're skeptical .
so you ask , for you have evidence that urge you some evidence .
take it 's nothing more than any given to myself .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you have to this evidence to assume , and in that we 're not good .
and i can that from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear for life , as i thought , if you never seen , to have and hopefully will never see again , let me .
in about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> lasts in the connection to .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
lots of studies should be conducted ; it 's a serious business .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no link , who does n't .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we all of anecdotes believe , we think , what we see , what we 're going to see to believe what does that we really feel .
we do n't think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> , the us data , there , and i do that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was catastrophic ,
and surreal because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , of on the immunization for <unk> down .
this is absolutely scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's terrible .
what happened , that we could do .
now , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because , here who <unk> ?
okay , one in the audience ever get one of <unk> was going to see ?
it 's not very often .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but 160,000 time on the world of the last year .
that are many deaths by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because it 's happening here is , we can it out , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms such as oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things to be seem , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he has liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no moons , polio , they shut , gone .
the guy in the center , not so good .
he called paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> gunpowder .
he can use the lives of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , besides that that paul and as well over the vaccines talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just quit should be able to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without armed foot on one of behavior .
he gets calls home , because the people to something like to tell you know where his children to school .
and why ? because paul a vaccine has done .
i do n't need this say , but vaccines are essential .
you take it continues to return to the disease , terrible disease , and this is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be kids back to die , because it 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just at <unk> die .
what about polio ? we take this . why not ?
a <unk> from me , i 'm a few weeks , there , and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would be your child 's not against polio vaccinate . on is no .
subtle .
why ? because we have no polio . and you know what ?
we had in this country , no polio .
now , i do n't know , maybe she morning is anyone in lagos , a plane and the right now , you 're going to los angeles , the moment he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , goes , he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight is gone .
and he does n't know that it with a stock disease , and there is , and we know that 's also not , because that 's the world now time .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if he does this is .
we love it to us in a lie to membrane . we love that .
they have the morning is all their vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the thing you can help .
i know , that you 've done , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and they take an alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out that it is futile .
the data up the time .
they put them up their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine numbers .
i 'm with them completely .
in their urine . the dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate each one to a strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , it can afford .
we 're so that way , and where i 'm going to ?
we walk in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we 'll give a billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of small , some here .
this does n't it -- <unk> , , <unk> , , <unk> , because i know it 's what that is , but we 'll give a billion dollars for it looks like , it was .
and you know what ? when i think that would say , as well , i was the people , and say , `` what does it , you ? let the people , but we do , what they want .
so you feel . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i don’t care is , whether it 's the minister is , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of experts to mammography does n't think , '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> treat wants .
if , in that went to think , and the magic evidence , and science to replace , get them to a place , and they do n't want to be .
they get to , i mean , in south africa .
he got 400,000 of people to , because he said that he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , which we know that it the course of aids , so you can .
hundreds of undue deaths in a country , the worse than any other side of this disease <unk> will .
you tell me , please do n't that these things are no consequences .
that have you . that they 've always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , in the time we 're in , is this ridiculous struggle between the <unk> <unk> valley food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , about metaphors .
this is the ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , every 're , from the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas trees . we have this all done .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of this has worked and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of what does n't work .
now we can it in doing . and of course , there 's risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that does n't you want to do ?
i must say , that i do n't .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
so what i always listening is : to a lot of chemicals , in fact , hormones , <unk> , we want to have a huge fields with one thing , it 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies alive and patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and you know , what my answer , on all this is ?
yes , they are right . find that we can .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
it 's kind of science is nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know that the science does n't company is .
it 's no country .
it 's not let 's an idea ; it 's a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it works , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we have the science is not allow you should , their work to do , because we 're afraid of this is a real dead , and it 's millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we will 70 percent more than growing food to as the moment , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
to do . to do .
they need that , and we give it 's not tell them .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it has no nutrients , it has no one protein , and scientists to build all that they 're looking at a .
and then you might be the people that food and i would n't think there are .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i 'm trying to say it is : why are we have that ?
i mean , we ask : why are we have that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , gene move . it 's not to throw chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our it be on more food , better food , act of food .
it 's not about the rice <unk> , it 's about , the lives to get , and it 's time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we keep doing as far i do we 're looking at a little bit guilty , that we , i think , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it is not worthy , and we need to that really want to be .
after this incredible kind of entertainment and you so you might say , you still in this ridiculous time and the future , go ? ''
anyway , . that i want , so this .
the moment is it in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this time to anything to ask , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we 're moving into those cases , and we are they 're going to move , where we want .
we need to those conversations lead , and we need to think , but if we 're in the time up , and the future , we will be happy to be that made .
i know that we do it can , and here 's me in this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 've come for the <unk> . it might seem curious , that , a magician interested in that , it 's because , you look at it as i , `` a deception , to a real is , when someone who just a enough that thinks . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , which is just so , because the person is going to her going to be a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there 's going to the patient 's just a enough that thinks , a measurable effect of the body , you the <unk> calls .
one that you 're going to a real , because somebody 's so the world .
so that we 're also understanding , i want to you now a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'll show you , and it works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s in any <unk> for children .
i even have taught him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s learned .
i 'm going to him for them out and it and then you explain .
and then i 'm going to explain , why i want to explain .
so , and you see what happens .
the knife , that they 're going to ; my hand , they 're going to .
i 'm going to the knife just so in my off .
i do you my sleeve back .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist right here <unk> .
this way you can see that , and none of time , you move . as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve around , or out .
and the goal is that 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare bodily magnetics lasted .
it 's actually so , its place to deliver it to shake it , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or comes out , no <unk> . and they do everything is a very much .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick , i was a little kids affect the ones , for magic interested , because you can do this very much about being able to learn , if you go closer look , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works , here .
i think that knife in my hand .
i say that i became my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason , why i was my wrist <unk> , is the , in that , the real secret of illusion is .
in the moment , where i mean by hand of them <unk> , so you 're going back of see , moves , this on here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the time he 'd like this extended .
wonderful trick ?
back there is someone , no childhood had .
so , it , this is here . right .
and when i 'm <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why this point of this is , why you do n't have facial that down here 's just three fingers to see that are , because the mind and the way , he information data , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but it as a group can see .
but that 's now here 's not actually , and then i open , i mean by hand .
and it 's where there would have no , but not by the magnetics my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , that on the same thing , and i <unk> , going through this movement hidden behind the finger , again <unk> .
i assume that 's gone . and there is the knife .
this trick that you can imagine your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what has this with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i 'm really right away from .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in a white pill offer , in the form of a <unk> , is that just a round , white pill , a certain measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the time you that <unk> feeding , for instance , in a smaller pill change , and these blue color and a letter that cloaking , it is actually measurably more .
and that , no matter of any pharmaceutical -- it are just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as well as a blue pill .
so that made me , really crazy .
and it , but that 's still not it 's .
if you capsules takes , the people are still more than pills and every form .
a colored capsule , at one end of yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
and the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well as three pills -- i can see me now , not at the exact does n't remember , you know i 'm sorry .
the really , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you see the ultimate <unk> have to make you to the needle grasp .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient gets into .
that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much more than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you a different times show , if we have a <unk> .
the fact , so this is that the white pill , not so well , it looks like the blue pill , not so well , it looks like a cramped capsule , not so well , it looks like the needle .
and none of has some really pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe it , in us a greater impact achieved .
i wanted to know that i did this idea for a magic trick could use .
i 'll do something that 's obvious point of this is , and let 's really look .
we know , from the study that you to the needle to grab , if it on the thing to go to .
this is a 18 two feet long <unk> . it 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you begin with a little sterilize .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no special effect of hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin and stick and through them up , until you to the other side , again laterally .
if you , it 's going -- if you can easily in almost fall -- i started this a few friends , the last night in the hotel room , the , and some people that i do n't know , and a problem is a woman , almost , he 'd become .
i 'm so , if you very quickly , it 's going , then you look for the next 30 seconds away . '' or , you know what , i 'm going to the first sensitive part of the back here .
it can see in , you can , but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my meat starts , the bottom of my <unk> , i 'm just a little puncture do .
you know i really sorry . it 's crazy ?
and now , just a little bit by my skin and the other side that way back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we do the <unk> lanes .
about .
but now they can make my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . this is a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , is not so stupid , and <unk> , the skin , just to us a few minutes long to talk . ''
now , then i 'm so it 'll show you .
look like this from ? well .
yes , i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i think that 's not right . ''
the people in the <unk> are now in .
you make it was to them from the right around us .
this is my skin . that is no special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that swivel .
you know i 'm sorry . if you , it 's going , look at the way , look at it .
the people back or the , that later , eventually , on video to see how to say , `` well , that it : yeah , fairly impressive , but if it 's really would , he would -- and you see here 's a hole and there , if it 's really would , it would bleed . ''
okay , let me a little blood for them <unk> .
yes , it there .
usually i would actually now the needle drive it .
i would have an oil and show you that 's no wounds .
but i think , in this from here and with the intention , from a deception that 's going to do , i 'm the needle just in there 's and so from the stage to go .
we 're going to us in the next few days , a couple of time to face .
i hope that you look forward , it is that . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people at the number of books are going to make that , `` <unk> '' in the title in the last five years out , and they have to think about 40 , and there 's still a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of interest of happiness under explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people have been doing .
but despite all of tide of work , there 's several cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to let 's clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive into action .
this is for reporter , of their own happiness might think , and it is for scientists , the lucky to think that , because it turns out that we just like this is what are like every other .
the first of falling is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out , that the word , just not a useful in the word , is , because we do it on to all of how to work .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , that we do it 's going to be , but in the great and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated , which you would have to specialize in the well-being is .
the second case is one of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between to be happy in his life and be happy about his life , or happy with his life .
and that are two very different concepts , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's unfortunate fact that we 're not about a situation that can think , the well-being of that , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example , they start by someone , that one <unk> had , sort of my lectures , that one story that it had . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely so the music , and , the end in this , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ruined .
but that i did n't .
what it , which had was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience of out .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care about it , because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all , what he goes to keep getting had .
what 's actually says this is that we 're talking about us and over the other people think we could in terms of two types of myself .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the present to live and the presence of us know , is able to the past back to experience , but in basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor asks : `` do now it hurts , i guess it 's <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our upright , left , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor 's been by it 's the question is : `` how do you have , it lately felt ? ''
or `` what was their journey , albania ? '' or that wrong .
that are two very different entities that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> itself , and the wonderful to confuse this is part of the <unk> the type of happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really with a basic reaction on our memories of -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we have to do , stories to tell .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we kind of our experiences , keep to do is a story .
and let them <unk> with an example , they start .
there 's an old study .
that are real patients that , a painful procedure into place .
i 'm not far into go . you today is not more painful , but it was painful , as this study the 1990s , and did was .
they were asked , all 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking , `` who from both have more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
the patient b 's clearly more suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how do really thought that these patients that they 'd suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise that is that person is a in a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very one big part of the story is , how it ends up --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is caused it , where the pain , the end on its peak . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these guys , after their <unk> asked to have , and as much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and it was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> ourselves and the <unk> itself .
of view of the <unk> itself , i 'd be a clear <unk> time .
so what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we 've actually clinical done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to extend by showing you just the hose in it 's no , very , to him up .
there 's going to the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that 's a few minutes for power , does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a worse off this is , and you have that does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a lot better on this is , because now , your patient is a in a story about his experience .
what we draw a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory that provides and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
what did a story i think are these cases , great moments , and the end .

so , that <unk> itself alive his life and continuously .
it has moments of the <unk> , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're going to always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i do that 's about -- you know , the psychological presence of than about three seconds long , which means , you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of that there . in a month , there 's about 600,000 . the most of you leave no lane .
the most of you can be completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet they get in terms of the sense that they are we assume that what during these moments of the <unk> happens in our lives .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're in the world .
and how we do you say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> yourself for us to keep .
so we do this <unk> ourselves and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the kind of time .
of view of the <unk> itself , if you a vacation . and the second one week , that 's good as the first , is the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that 's actually not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation hardly any more than the <unk> vacation , because there is no new memories , which i 'd be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and this way is time , the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . the time , very little impact on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , the decisions which is , because if you a patient who have the heat , we say , two <unk> in two different surgeons had , and decide , which he would choose to , is the , the votes of the memory , the less bad news is , and this is the surgeon , selected will .
that <unk> itself has no voice in that choice .
so we choose not between experiences . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we 're looking at the future thinking , we think of our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
but basically , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> itself , and they do that <unk> even think more than one that kind of the <unk> itself <unk> through the experiences that the <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the sense that if we 're going to the very often the case is , that means we do on vacation largely in a little bottle of the <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we kind of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of the <unk> itself , there will .
and when i think about , i think of a vacation , we have a few years in antarctica . they 've done , at the best vacation was , i ever had , and i think quite often it relates to the tools that , how often , i have another <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever , the folder open , you have to look at 600 images that i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are at a half hours .
because it seems a disagreement , to do .
now , i like a little extremely , you know , it , how little appetite , i think that <unk> of memories , to have , but myself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we have these are there ?
so i want to that you about a thought experiment to think .
imagine , you want their next month 's , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures are going to , and they get a <unk> drug , so that , nothing to remember .
now , you were the same to vote ?
and if you a different to vote would , there 's a conflict between your two types of ourselves and they have to think about , this conflict decide , and it 's really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking , you get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think you could one another answer to get .
why we have the <unk> pick out that we do is a problem , that , we do with a choice between the two types of myself .
now , the two types of ourselves into two in terms of happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , of per itself .
so they can ask : how happy that 's <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy are those moments in the <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- luckily for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured can be ?
and the way , we 're now in a pretty good idea to get the lucky , the <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the lucky , the <unk> myself wondering , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about it , as happy one person who lives .
it 's kind of information , as happy or by the person is , if this person about their lives , it turns out .
very different .
everybody , those terms , not being different is the study of happiness -- it up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness long screwed have on that way .
the distinction between the lucky , the <unk> ourselves and the average happiness in the <unk> itself is in recent years , i realized that was , and now , which you , the individual , to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , more than a half million people ask , which has been are about that you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another efforts in the direction .
in recent years , we have so i started to talk about the lucky , the two types of ourselves to learn .
and the main lesson that we , i think , we 've learned is that they really different .
you know , as being someone with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about how to be happy , he would be living her life and vice versa .
only to you an idea of the correlation to convey the correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size , you know ?
now , it would do something about its size , you know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody his life than eight on a scale of 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about how to be happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what that does the <unk> down .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness , basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , the time to spend with people that we 'd like .
there 's another pleasure , but this is a dominant .
so if you know that was fortunate enough of those two types of ourselves to maximize that we want you going to the very different things to do .
the implication of the oven , what i 'm here said , to have this is that we 're lucky , it does n't imagine you should be as a substitute for comfort .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , a reason , we 're not clear about happiness can think this is that we 're not on the same things are when we talk about the life thinking and if we actually live .
so if you the simple question to ask , as happy in the people in california are you will not the correct answer to get .
if you that question , imagine if you see that the people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think you think of the difference between california , and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful itself , that decides to be happy , people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , they can see the end -- some people might the end , california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people that , california , pull in the hope , i have to be .
now , her <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that they have are , because if you think about them to be of it , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel that it is the right decision met .
it 's very difficult to clear about well-being thinking , and i hope , i do you an idea of it gives , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks , on that we 've mentioned before they 're going to me that 's a pretty interesting result , that , from this <unk> survey came .
it 's something , what you to participate , let you can , because they 're now a few minutes left to have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most result , that we have the <unk> survey , we have found is a number that we absolutely not to find what we did .
we found that in the lucky , the <unk> itself .
if we looked at the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out , that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people unhappy , and they are increasingly less and the poorer countries , they are .
that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obvious that the money , no <unk> charged , but that the lack of money , certainly do you , and we can see this misery very , you measure .
in the sense of the other itself , the <unk> itself , you get a different story .
ever more money you have made more and helped me is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american now it 's going to live , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people that finding seriously , we would take , i mean , it all the head to ask , everything , what we think , for instance , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians , that the country , generally a complementary finding out how to take seriously would and that 's based on governance to make up ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's recognition , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does it , and in other countries that happens , they 're .
the people are in , recognizing that they 're going to happiness might think should , if you , politics , thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss , achieving <unk> exploring those or whether they <unk> exploring those cases , so we need to this debate pretty soon .
how you 're lucky , because it 's very differently depending upon it , as you think , and if you know , that <unk> even think , or if you know , that <unk> even think .
this is going to influence , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> of course , to measure .
this is , i think , in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should have the most important political debate , there will be over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i design games .
i think of now been 10 years that online . and my goal for the next decade is , it 's easy to do , the world in the reality to save , in <unk> to save this is .
i have a design for . i want to more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole time for games . ''
maybe something to kind of time , when you think about how many problems we need in the real world to solve .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most of the world to solve .
in fact , i am convinced that , if we look at the next century on this planet to want , we have this time to dramatically increase the center .
i figured out that took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week .
it appears first , maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it would do you ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think , we need to try to play online for at least 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of very much right , why i believe that play , so critical for survival of the human species in the future . it seriously .
this is a her of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so it 's going on the players have a camera .
this is one of the classic of the play .
if you ca n't think are , we think , you is a couple of nuances in this picture .
you probably this sense of urgency , something , but also antithesis of concentration , very <unk> in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also , you see some of nuances here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouths are a sign of optimism . the brow show surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called epic victory .
oh , you know that . ok , well . so we have some outstanding players here .
a <unk> victory is a result , this very good news is that they had n't know that it does it was possible .
it was almost the imagination .
and if it 's going to reach , they 're shocked to keep them in fact , that can do . this is a <unk> victory .
this player 's just a epic victory .
and this is it , what we conceive of millions of their faces of <unk> around the world look like to say , if we have the next century in the attack us . the face of those that at all odds , the edge of epic victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more of the face in real life , if we are difficult problems with .
i call it as `` in life , i 'm pretty bad . '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , as i believe that , `` in life , i 'm pretty bad . '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i 'm in my ph.d. studying why we 're in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem , that many player .
we think that we have the reality is not so well , are like in games .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that this is it .
we reach in <unk> anymore . i mean , in the context of the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to deal with each other .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in our best version into , anytime and immediately <unk> are , you 're the ability to try , so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we 're going on the barriers to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated correctly . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in play it 's just not .
and this is it , what i 'm a student to look at .
why is it in games impossible to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality is able to ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals environment , made a problem solving offers .
and i have some things we found that epic weak party in <unk> as possible .
so , first , if you in one of online into , in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , which is immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission , the perfect to her current level of the game , right , right ?
so i do this .
they have no one task , you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so we have , you want to do better . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and about six . there 's always very specific something important to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , with them together to evaluate their epic mission to conclude .
that we have in real life , not just like that , this sense that in a <unk> scores of employees are willing to stand .
and there 's this epic history , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have this one of `` level , '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard , `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage was leaving , i did not , is plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life , this feedback .
so , the problem of <unk> like the world of warcraft , is , that it might satisfaction is , anytime , the edge of epic victory to stand out that we prefer to our whole time in these <unk> spending .
they 're just better than the reality .
until now have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to it 's in the context to see , of <unk> million years , i started our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright primate so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now with play spend , it 's just a sense , when you , the time in terms of scale of human development of people are holding , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out , that we , and we all of this time to play using , in fact that change , what we as people in the position .
we 're going to us to collaborative user , very much creatures .
this is the truth . that i think .
at once they have this interesting , the recent graduating from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man , in a country with a strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . the age .
so , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons .
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that they 're looking at school spend , of the fifth . great to spend in the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have this is a complete <unk> , young people just learning , what it , a good poker player , like anything other , what they 're looking at school .
and may have any of the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of a lot of 10,000 hours .
it builds on the great research on the <unk> that , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> studies of any subject to the 21st century . the age of them , we 're going to coming in it .
we are so good at , and to do what the most people in the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people that <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are just are really good ? ''
because if we do it out how could , if we have sort of that i 've never been there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour per day with <unk> spending .
that are our <unk> . 500 million people that information -- well , `` something '' are .
and the next decade , we have another one billion players , the information -- well , what 's also always .
if it 's still do n't have heard ,
the games are evolved <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil online , they can play .
you 're expecting an additional billion player in the next decade .
so we have total 1.5 billion player .
so i started to go to look what it is , at us these games to coming to do .
here are the four things that i found . first of : <unk> .
ok , imagine if you how to extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , right to be done , a challenge to coming , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope on success .
i believe , that a <unk> victory is possible , and that it , it 's worth , it to try , which is the same .
just are not sit around .
are masters of spiders poet of social nets .
there 's a lot more interesting research , the show that we are more like , after we do with you 've been playing , even if it 's happening defeated correctly .
the reason for this is that 's lots of trust requires , with someone is a game to play .
we rely on that somebody out with us on the rules <unk> , that we did the goal , and to the end of the head .
so the technologies that we see that grow from going to trust and each other .
as a result of that we build their social relations on .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week plays , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually have the hard to work , as if we wanted to relax or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings that can work , if we make hard , where they do .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the task .
and eventually , epic meaning .
i love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> mass .
here 's a <unk> , that the right light to the back . you are lots of wikipedia , the biggest <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost 80,000 entries is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft in the internet , we 've been than about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they 're creating a epic story .
they 're creating a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single outcome . are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people that we believe that it as a single change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the issue that i want to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he looked at , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spending .
and he says , `` we 're going to the idea of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not like i -- i think of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that makes you actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> more reaching than in real life .
you can in games in their social ties with each other than in real life . they get more feedback and rewards in games as in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently entirely obvious that are more time in the virtual world as in the real spending .
i agree that first time , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely no <unk> .
we need to start , the real world in a game into paintings .
my daily basis comes from an event , the 2,500 years back .
there 's this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic sketch , there 's <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> are familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games invented by .
according to <unk> were games , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine invented .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine in the king of <unk> , and make a crazy idea i decided that .
the people who suffered . the people who were .
it was an extreme situation . you took an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day to play .
and they were as much in the <unk> <unk> being given that play , so fascinating are and us , as , <unk> productivity by that you remember that would be that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day to play . and the next day would you eat .
and according to <unk> allowing them so for 18 years that famine , by them in one day , eating and the next to come .
as well , i think , do we use today , games .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world to get away .
we put play a cell to all due to avoid that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life , not satisfaction is , and we bring us what we need of the play .
but that does n't been the current .
that 's exciting .
according to <unk> became , 18 years of famine , not better . so i decided to the king , a final <unk> that we need .
they did the kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner got to a epic adventure , it .
they were <unk> and now , the quest for a new home . they were just so many people , how it 's food to survive there and looking out with the rest for an area , in the time they are able to .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , the later that was that -- in the , the same dna as the old <unk> about it .
so , and scientists recently , of that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and geologists found evidence of global cooling , almost 20 years for what the famine explain to be .
so i could take these crazy story to vote .
you might have actually their people through play rescued by taking to do for 18 years in games escaped , and then these <unk> , and so much about the playing with each learned that it by the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .
we 're playing since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
i say , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of your civilization , for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at <unk> that half of us an hour per day with play , she starts to become the problems with the real world have solved .
i know , they 're going to ask : `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in play ? '' and that question i mean work in recent years at the center for the future devoted .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it on them from , how we 're going to understand what should .
we do n't want to mitigate the future of channelrhodopsin to say .
what we want , is the future of law .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people that powerful , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine epic wins , and give people in the ways , you to achieve .
i 'll show you very quickly three games that i designed to have to try to people epic weak party in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , in that you a <unk> overcome .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for them , it will and you very real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to play register , they tell us , where you live . and then get them <unk> in real , the show you , how much oil costs , what 's not there , because food , those is going to transport those are going to school closed are , whether it 's the middle there . and they 're going to figure out how you very real life make if it 's true to be dead . and we ask them , about to blog , videos or photos , to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 tested . and we have you ever since the last three years , too .
and i can tell you , it was a in the experience .
nobody wants to live , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if they asked in epic adventure are and told you get , `` let 's about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating adventure , that you go .
they find out , how they were going to . the most of players have the game <unk> habits , we could .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , at the goal , you 'd rather than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> that the people just , 23 years on the planet , and there .
this supercomputer called `` global <unk> <unk> '' of course .
the call to players , to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it , `` <unk> '' there . they have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of the only five million people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 players who were at the five weeks for .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you read that if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we bring the three . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
you look at the end , get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' in 2010 .
we 're working with the universities , sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic book on this . we have `` level , '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to you all invite , this game with a young people to share , the world , in <unk> , of benefits , put together in their own social enterprises , to imagine , the world to save .
i 'm now to end .
i want to you ask .
what , you think that happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that gives us to know what we can do , but we have to the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope you to me in that i agree that are human resources are , we 're going to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for change .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to close social nets to knit , <unk> and that for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we put together in history play games to stand on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope that they 're going to me to play design and play .
if i want to the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that 's safe , that we have any <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> , i 'll start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about what to me a few months to write an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write , my <unk> our questions , but i was playing with the kind of the <unk> already done , and i fell on that i still never in my life <unk> have to the word `` disabled , '' is really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> , healthy , strong , which is exquisitely . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and i had to find laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` up '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and i had to stop to read and me why do n't know , this <unk> <unk> and the with <unk> emotional shock .
and it was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought that the copy , very old to be .
but actually it was a copy on the early 1980s , when i just with the primary school , i started and so began to my self outside of the family with her to build and to form , in terms of other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god is so i was no <unk> used .
i 'd like this post take seriously , i would go in a world was born , that someone like me as a person who are able to be talking about to live in <unk> in a positive that i can . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately , the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expecting me to come here a <unk> contribution to find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
happen , it 's not much better .
especially shock me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it 's the values , in these words stuck , and how we have these values that gives us .
our language affects our thinking and how we have the world and the people to see around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the way of <unk> a great force , because that , what you out loud <unk> , also <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- one of those people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they 're not limit , and you have <unk> .
it would not beautiful , you doors to open ?
a person , for me doors has opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . and dupont institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , like , you think that the most americans are not accurate and it could . so he was always dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful fly and i was for the work with kids , just like water .
i found the time , i went in that hospital spent just have , just great -- until on my <unk> .
i had one exercises seemingly infinitely often are living with these heavy , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> building . and i have this on more vilified as everything else . i did they hated . i want you blinding glimpse . i think they hated .
and you imagine , i actually , as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and that 's trying to this exercise to stop , <unk> without success .
and one day , he told me in terms of my favorite exercises at -- this exercise was simply , and -- -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you will one day of on whatsoever .
and if you get it says , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do that will do that i do n't really wanted to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-olds girls in the ward in the floor . but it 's got me in fact that brought to my daily <unk> with new eyes to see . so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl with my self shaped , and i was so imagine being able to me as a kind of the strong , powerful and <unk> person to see .
it 's just a sample of you , as adults in <unk> the imagination of a child your risk .
but like that 's been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , something to imagine , what we all want to be : it every single entry to themselves , as powerful people to see .
our language is behind the social changes afterwards , in many cases , through a technology changes triggered by .
the medical from at you can kind of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium and becomes <unk> for the aging body , it will allow people , really all their opportunities to use , little bit about the borders , you your natural destiny , put it has to figure out to develop , not to speak of social <unk> platforms , to people , one of your own identity , there , on its own way , and the way it is that , and , with the world , who believe that they do , choose .
maybe the kind of so this technological change and clear , because i ever seen that it 's always been a different than that there , which is that every person in the society 's something very <unk> and very powerful tool that there can and that the human ability , which were , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that 's an interesting story , because people to me , that you ask them to tell , i do with the odds , i deal , and i 'm going to you to confess , that sentence , for me , never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
that sentence in the way of odds lives of the idea that success or happiness and depending on , a challenge to coming , without any of the way , so on the experience of a designer . as if my life , so successful that i would , because i was the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic of it could , like , and people to me with my disability perceive .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we 're talking about the challenge of a designer , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two days .
and what i 'm saying that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> to be able to stand up with our lives better clear to come .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to be adversities as my shadow to see .
sometimes i realize that he 's very your mind is , sometimes it 's not likely to see , but he 's time with me .
and i want to do n't , the impact or obstruction . the very challenging the <unk> of people degrading .
there 's in your odds , and challenges , and that are just <unk> real and each person 's so slightly differently . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds are coming to or , but how we 've seen it 's coming .
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love , in front <unk> to preserve , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we 're going to our kids do n't like , if we do you feeling that there is that it , not able to .
you have to two things you 're : one thing , the medical fact , an to be , and to the other , the social something about this , if i disabled , or not .
and to be honest , the only real and persistent disabled , i just sit down to , is that the world and says , you can take me with these definitions of .
in our desire , the people to protect , the heart of and you the cold , of truth about their medical prediction informs or even a forecast the quality to imagine that they would expect , we have to that we 're not the really started to put that somebody actually a result is .
maybe this is in the concept , the only to pay attention , what 's in a broken , is , and how that to fix , for every single one more profound disability than the pathology labs .
if we have a people are not treat them , and not all its forces and opportunity to perceive and acknowledge , we do in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a human , for our society , a value .
so we need to the <unk> look out and us on all of the human opportunities to focus .
the most importantly , but this is that 's between the perception of our pushing up and our great ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those challenging , it was n't stop degrading , or in denial , we should n't try to bring them to avoid , we should use them under the return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to see it .
it 's about me , maybe it 's more , clear to imagine that we gave , not necessarily need to get to , but that we started to open are , you to hug , and make it really seize to stick to also a <unk> to use , maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , gave , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel so through their presence , not more than that had .
the year in a celebration , we spend 200 . it 's birthday of charles darwin and when he 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my eyes , on something very real in the human nature of this out .
i would it 's so what , not the most of its survive , and also not the <unk> of , but the , changes the question to be .
from conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability to people , to survive and <unk> , the fight the human mind , this is , and conflict to turn .
so , again , by adapting and are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know , to figure out of wood and we pinched are , if we really have to be .
maybe this is that the sense of the odds , a sense of these eyes , a sense of our own power .
we can be so even something like to give them .
we can be adversities , a new meaning of the tough times beyond goes .
maybe we can be adversities , you see the change .
he gave up for a change , that we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the biggest damage , we even added to have , is to believe that we normally it should .
well , frankly , who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there 's the usual . that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , this person who really know , learn to , if you really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality against a different kind of options , or the strength , it even still a little bit dangerous to me restate that they could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release and they 're going to invite , their very particular , and those skills in the society in .
<unk> have , what we found that we humans from the members of our society , a lot of claimed , to be , and a contribution to do .
there 's cues that , the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe bodily injury to have worn and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for the society value was .
they have these people are not as a broken and useless at ; they were as something special and those treated .
a few years , i went around the city , in the time i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> tomatoes .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear , as a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> . ''
and i turn me , and see this her husband . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we 've got us ? i ca n't , you . ''
and he said , `` well , yeah , i 'm sure , hardly at me remind me .
when i do it 's the first time i saw , i was led them from the belly of her mother had taken . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
that was dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks , too late came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics -- my mom was in on , and so we knew my parents of the man , the me to the world 's got , all .
and because i do without <unk> was born , and my feet , for them for you had , and i just a few toes , this and a few toes across the foot , he was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news your book .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents tell you to do n't walk , would , and it 's never mobile , i would like the other children or that you never been a completely independent life lead could talk , and since they 've got me just lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood collected , whatever , if i held in <unk> in the second grade won , if i do with the <unk> in the mermaid parade to <unk> traveling was , whatever , if i do for a fellowship or of my <unk> wins <unk> , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human , willing .
you can just not enough to point , how critical of a factor for the quality of people can be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone to deal , two different things are .
and i 've got my thinking over the time has changed , if you leave me the age of 15 years , they were saying , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone <unk> have , then i would have no one second <unk> .
i want to come back then they normally work .
if you leave me that is to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , i have and not in spite of these experiences .
and maybe we could this change that 's also happen , because i was so many people in a while i am , my door opened have , instead of people to go , i cut or me an idea on .
and you see it really just a human , you demos , their forces <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if it 's someone in the lives , his own , inner forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for anyone in a critical moment of the door busts open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , to bring that i 'm in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential to think we , it ?
in the '60s years was in britain 's a <unk> done . when they were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` nowadays <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students to be able to music is it .
and that a student will be <unk> harder to have to get the better teacher , etc .
they have , then over a <unk> period of students , `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very well , '' i described . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would be . and after these three months , you have really <unk> written .
and obviously <unk> it , the heart to hear that the other way the <unk> been said , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only one of us who still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school , throwing lanes .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers wo n't know that something changed .
you 've been just told that are the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only real disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope . he 's nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , one dollar curiosity . and our innate capacity to the imagination .
if we do it , but i do , the human spirit in order to support to continue to hope for themselves , and people to , around . if you find , and <unk> to be , then to put our forces really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities that , we can be a new reality , and new <unk> create .
i want to a poem by saying that one of persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written by the me , my friend jacques <unk> tells the subject . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words . '' `` every child knows , not the god , the name , not the god , the banned , but the god , the only four words , you know , and these are repeated , he says , just : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
