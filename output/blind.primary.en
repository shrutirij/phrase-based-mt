yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
well , thank you for the references here today to talk .
and i have to me , now -- imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to an term , <unk> in the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to talk is an organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , so you do , not very popular .
i know .
and it out , and that 's something about my son , particularly like , i also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , is a subject matter , i want you today <unk> to .
because , and the topic <unk> , because this is also heard the fire .
we hope for the best and for us on the worst , and that has jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i 'm starting to do n't , so for her to say .
i <unk> them a position .
so we talk , if it 's a risk is that we on , a stand , for <unk> <unk> , from rush .
many people are the way .
it is , it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard about any .
suddenly an <unk> .
and leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire , <unk> .
people .
officials <unk> .
they go out .
what 's because this ? , asking passersby .
we realize that we also not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
so to cry .
some of may actually , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , who failed .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic breaks out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards . i 'd like your imagination .
but it 's no imagination , that i <unk> . <unk> ?
this is this , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase full of them .
afterwards she turned out , that only , in <unk> , nine billion pounds of drugs that were .
but the people were just so , and that has a friend told me that tells , building forced into .
it was n't told .
and it was that same who suddenly at least in the group on that my friend in my friend , i found myself .
god is `` thank you is n't panic that have , otherwise would be the whole thing that we are not so safe to run out how it .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is kind of a very important .
it 's important , because the people at this is literally , communication <unk> .
they want to know what 's because it .
they used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't have said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because it 's called the <unk> ruled .
you , so that made to say , god , the people get in panic , say , we would n't like the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time , she and public television is not more possible .
`` and really , so therefore , because it 's one is not morally is , and secondly , are anyway , we have the last than the agency , the over the event report .
you remember , perhaps , at the one in the hudson river , is a year , here .
the first reporting about it was at twitter .
by someone , on a ferry was , and just and emotional immediately <unk> , here 's a plane quantifiable -- and we save the people now .
it was not <unk> .
you see that we 're dependent on , today , which simply and emotional , unless the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because most are we think of course , the past , the supposedly , the truth will know , because when we do n't we need to say , to notice that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media either ca n't pay so that are , or they do it also not .
from therefore , we will be in the food , and that 's also something that even by the media has gone are , we think about how we 're in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we will be the good old puppet back out .
but just as a form of <unk> .
that means that we 're going to the next few years about a hundred puppet in the <unk> build that , some of you know that , <unk> , if it 's going to this <unk> coming .
they used it was so .
you may be you know , what 's three briefly , once in short , once a long and once a means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the world today is linking up with all <unk> that we , to have , so <unk> , of facebook , twitter , over the radio <unk> , at night , over the tv and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> to stand up at the information on to get .
and we know , we need to go there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to go there 's very quickly and <unk> -- so , because the zones , and citizens to be otherwise frightened .
and we ultimately , not anymore , that to believe what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one in a question of the rapidity of all media , to stand , and it 's also a question of credibility .
credibility is our biggest problem , because the zones , and citizens to say , either , oh , the things in time again , right , it 's not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's all very much worse than it in reality is .
we have so as good experience to be done with facebook and twitter , so long ago .
and that you may have some of in them on the media from .
we have a longer <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and that is a place called chemical bomb .

the problem is just , many of bombs -- i 've never works and it continues to go , in <unk> one of the food <unk> .
and we were from an elderly gentleman , be some extent , and it so beautiful in the turnaround said , to decide to , we now , he had seen how they <unk> forty-three by it 's right , and <unk> he 's the authority over this is that 's a bomb . laughter throughout the background .
the way , since i have , several older , the cases in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we still find everything .
these bombs to immediately shifts of place , not defused , but in fact .
and so then we have in <unk> park , which simply and really , one , in every sense of the word , a bomb gloomy .
and the first time in history of the city of the communications of facebook and twitter , let it run with the consequence of the entire <unk> far over <unk> <unk> total followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter throughout the background .
we had n't even with are telephony , but that have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
this was a great effect for us , because the credibility is dominated by increased about these social media .
just so , they have to me as a sign that there , when i went on the individuals .
i can go from this is not at the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media and the advantage we have that you very much information to pass .
it 's not very <unk> are , because the members that there are continuing or the <unk> , as you call them , a high <unk> .
secondly , which we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that someone who immediately , so that the credibility that , i just talked to have to say this is , because of the whole community in principle of the reports that there is .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , so if anything that 's wrong , it 's very fast as you correct .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> that 's exciting found , as a bomb in <unk> park up goes .
from that we 've come from all the things that in the last few years is happening there are , and it are much more <unk> happens when intense encounter a still think , as intense encounter a third .
and the city of food , every day of such a home and looking to be .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but they can also , after <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i am , we see there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and when the , if you see in munich , you think of other cities , if the then in fact to cure , because it 's called a <unk> , the way to conventional or not to defuse can , then we know already , to be a variety of houses , not more than that look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> which is necessary , communication to do anything to leave you also turns out to stop , for about to take that the people what are going to come to worry about to carry that the people in the are able to , these difficult situation , to .
and the social media to help us , the credible , because ultimately , they all of the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> to the big part .
from so now is <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross et etc. , but of communication in the disaster , and with a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and over facebook , a lot of the help the time , if we also know , and you still with the kind of was , because suddenly <unk> of people to any <unk> building to have , and you know what does n't even more where the <unk> .
this is also , there 's still a lot to do , indeed , the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the region has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think about .
and i hope that i do you a little convinced of you have to this media , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used , in <unk> its meaning and purpose of and that we as a city , for the for the <unk> in charge is , this instrument , in the future , and then , new , and very different as well be able to her , to the citizens to use the zones , and citizens and so the end , i now , and thank me very much for your attention , when i want you have the time , barely seen this .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> differently .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm now , they also , and , really a <unk> to the reasons .
what it is that i was there <unk> make me , that in , i also give them in a few years ago .
before i do that , i must , but a few things <unk> .
the first is that , i believe that we are really want to life , you need .
that we live without stories , it could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite possibility is , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and four , i 'm <unk> convinced of that people that were created , to be creative .
and that they have are , once you to be creative people can .
ever more people are happy , if you do it 's the world .
it makes sense .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i want to do , starting to midnight in an area , in just happy <unk> singing will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the disposition and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , of on it strikes midnight , so it is , something happens with her .
it 's something in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and it 's not really word for .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i 've all the word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one side <unk> and do in <unk> and everything is quite white .
i ' feeling that i am somehow quite <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other side , we 've got the two in the <unk> oz with very very much color .
and it was , in , once told that i 'd better <unk> and writing , when that i draw .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions can see that 's a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her is , you very seriously at , and says , very much congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> educates <unk> about it on that you to a very special kind of people have heard .
it was as <unk> born .
are people that go from their <unk> have to her lifetime to be .
who of you know <unk> ?
very good .
so you , the <unk> at <unk> not swords , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so cube , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish is to each of a long life , but we know what 's just not .
it till everything , by being .
and so it 's in my players , so .
you know , do n't want to how it because actually can play .
that means , again , every lost minute that the last have to be .
a player , his entire lifetime <unk> , <unk> in the moment of <unk> as a candle that <unk> will .
now , this can kind of questions : if that because this is dangerous , why games , then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , i 'd want to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does , he 's actually alive .
that were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and how you 're now the world , the players <unk> , your first challenge is , and of course , inevitably in <unk> love , is the story that i want to do .
and that is in the form of <unk> .
the first season has 12 , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens , i just to be late seen this .
so , twelve follow the first season with a total length of each , five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a consequence for the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know .
that television makes for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all be , if only ' i now , first time . it .
and i do n't actually here .
now let 's , but , we 're .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most famous set of the movie or from the series ?
it can only one , there , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have happened .
and that 's true of my players , which is not to .
of which is it 's very many , there .
there 's so many different games .
you think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so , and so on .
and that <unk> is also the number of the players .
and so it 's a lot of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is it because it all share ?
i ' already quite a high opinion of me .
i 'm giving me for sufficiently smart and to be creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brain , producing than just one , let 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the process of creates .
what would be , if we <unk> not just breed or to allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much , the development of this <unk> with the thing .
so you , for example , in the result , three diving into a <unk> on , it is completely class of finding , because he would you for example of her grandfather reminds us .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just with the modern technology is that yes , do n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience down this is .
that is , it 's not anywhere under , but it ends up the right there , where it up to .
that really nice thing is that we 're in the internet .
and the internet , yes , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of interactions .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , spin , and they do want .
and if we also now , this structure through .
it looks <unk> little bit of <unk> net , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced of the internet was born , what a lot of these stories to tell .
it just doing , unfortunately , not so many , or at all that none .
so , now saying , i said , but even still a step further and in the audience , i have to the player .
because in a <unk> .
because you can against characters from the series , who , but also against people in the real environment , as these <unk> on your phone .
phrases here , you know how are also all very well , are something like mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful areas that , just very rapidly developing countries .
and the time i do n't you can , because i do over again , 20 minutes , i 'd need .
we ca n't even together .
everybody 's time on it 's made of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> , i was kind of the jury of the moment , i got that a little detect : the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
that have to me as the price for the best <unk> described .
and i want to say , these jury was all of legislators of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good people , you want to my .
and if i was the convince you can , here with my : the internet , using the narrative structures to revolutionize the way , still better world , then i think , i can actually every convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why is the whole , this ?
because it alone in this one on all areas covered .
we have of course , first of the <unk> : who is it , i 'm on it , you 're on it , everybody 's time .
and then that die .
in the time series of it 's very much died .
everybody 's time you mean , everyone needs to time to die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time has done in terms of everyone can be part , when he 's going to .
this is that i really important .
i 'll get ' from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you 've seen that .
if you in the theater are and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please , not me .
and this is it 's not .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason why i german speaking is the that the project , on the german will be , the first place .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while the way , and i was again and wondered : go to this , but in english , they 're the bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and i can just say , the german <unk> is the largest emitter of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in some small niche move .
and i believe that actually really , if it also the other people that 's like me that the people to be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the bottom and then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> had been .
if that everything that 's , as i thought it would have , about the first of the result now on the first in <unk> online .
and if they 're going to ask , why i , because now i 'm here in a <unk> , where it under the headline <unk> worth <unk> running .
and i also a couple of the time .
i love <unk> .
not only <unk> .
i 'm also quite on the amount of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .

but it uses , it 's nothing , if you as it gets .
and my project is simply <unk> thing where i just let 's all taken , to have , what i was so i 've learned this .
and it applied this .
and yet it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you now , who thinks , i want to do have been my bit of a large , i had degrees ' an idea <unk> character or i ' a drawing <unk> cartoon or what and that 's also already now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
well , in the thing to talk .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome to : you can memories are ?
the question of them .
you can memories are ?
you can you , because of all remember , what in your life ever happen is ?
they 've still <unk> forgotten ?
who has who can , all remember ?
it 's no hands up .
so you 're memories are ?
apparently already .
thank you .
no , just like that we want that 's us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk , pretty quickly .
let 's good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , tonight , i 've chosen , because it 's two of my passions or my two great passions currently together .
i ' , here in the near the computer science , studied and i did , let me just with the bits and bytes busy , the world today is that big through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm now , as a coach , and consultants , in private and professional field hides his way .
on the one side and i 'm so with the `` well , very much too , the other side , i 'm now it in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that 's the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the beginning to one of these two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can say to , when we can build a computer , that 's like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we 've gotten pretty close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that 's not anymore .
but , let me , do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little needs .
so the comparison between the computer on the one side and our brains to the other side .
if we have the computer , and then based , everything , so your smartphone , you a tablet , her <unk> and these cameras , and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .

these are parts , all of the ocean transistors .
the word has certainly , all heard , and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle , and the arts .
that <unk> little device that has three to add and forth accordingly electricity , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i ' extra <unk> , about five hundred million of little parts .
and the switch , because they have this .
we can store stuff , we 're going to calculate the things , we had degrees ' just albert einstein , you hear , 'n computers can all you can be very much , very quickly , but actually , it just zero and one for contrast .
more and he ca n't .
he 's actually quite made me .
we want it 's compare with our brain .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass up here in there .
the nice , but is , our our neurons have not only three connections , but that have to <unk> per neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> from , just because it 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 , 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of the brain is to make a higher than that , what we now , when computers .
we want to the <unk> time to say , maybe that have a or another idea of the of the first supercomputer that had their own power station on up , ha , who were , and with the <unk> the <unk> became the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is , and this is , the equivalent of two great bananas , so , you do n't and her , she 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant good calculator with <unk> , why we use , then not , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out in the internet , so , the human being uses only 10 percent of the brain , buy it now this <unk> to the <unk> brain .
and <unk> because they 're wrong , the advertising is a little .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution , at this mass pups , that was , <unk> smaller , in the middle of us is still our <unk> with inside , anything other , <unk> educated .
this is not to happen because we do n't that we use .
why it seems to try and so we used to the biggest of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the notion of pun ?
the i compared ' , and so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , you see , in the ocean , is the top , so the top , then there 's the ocean , down there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that are this is that 's what our sense , our <unk> mind is , <unk> running , but nine-tenths percent , and she 's a giant <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the point of that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow ♫ but we <unk> creative .
and the time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people that , suddenly , much more detail it can remember when i do n't seen , ' in the situation <unk> , and that tell you then <unk> , i ' said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
that goes , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody on the most on a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , okay , so good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , he got , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow ' not , over rome flown , which , rome at my , so rome is yes , now ow ' not necessarily the city , which , after a gigantic signs of myself on and has started , rome to draw .
and that 's not somehow , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window , he once seen it , he <unk> , it could be back to paper to bring .
how do is now that ?
so why can kind of that , why we ca n't that , well , he 's also be a very close to the <unk> little bit more access on his nine-tenths percent of the craft .
now we use the yes , but why i can now , not the hard to the <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> from me has to find interesting about what 's done .
he has even for example , you 've been working and has done with a rape , that had her experience is completely eliminated , this was n't even more mind , that <unk> <unk> by the brain , that 's not happening , that 's gone .
it is : so that came the very well , right .
now i went , but it , and get <unk> to do .
there has it in a very safe session , the end , or after this event back to , do n't even more active , it could n't remember , she was then the hallmark of the car see , of these people <unk> , that was not <unk> , that at its feet , and .
and actually is with the hallmark of the perpetrator expressed .
the second , what i think it 's found that was , he has a lady in <unk> had that has told that her mother , and alice in wonderland read , when they 're small was , four years .
because i sat them , which resulted in your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he 's her , in trance , goes , but the time ago .
then she have begun to read , it was four than that 's happened , they could then , you ca n't read , today can look at this .
and then you have said , he said , i tell me , <unk> .
they 've actually a copy from alice in wonderland found , right on this side of the text , and was , the lady read .
the brain , so this page as it was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so , we actually have access to that , but we seem like , there in the normal life , we say <unk> of <unk> to have to us to not <unk> .
and now that we said yes , not the event , in fact , but how <unk> have said , he 's a back a picture that way , in a <unk> , we can store , rather , our responsive , so that , what we see that , what we will get that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you 're now <unk> at a yellow lemon thinking and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> impression , like the taste , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> slightly above and , you can i ask you to conclude , they just a very quickly your eyes .
and remember , a very 're , positive event in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you go to do , you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part of getting .
they get , maybe a picture , a movie ?
some of the fact , not only on , because we 've felt that normally do , but that they do all the first time i realized that .
and if you see that , it , that they 're either in the movie are , from their eyes , all the experience , as you , you see on a canvas .
this one , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they 're allowed the final thought back to solve , to the eyes back up .
who has , because a visual information to get , let 's hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n one-third of what i would say , yeah , it is that 's what i expected to have , it is it 's actually something that we 're so often do that it 's the first moment , not sure .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what we also is beautiful , of memories , if you memories <unk> , is yes , not just that memory up , <unk> <unk> feeling that we <unk> a positive event , and i was , the one or another smiling can see , there was so yeah , it was beautiful , there were , they laugh , and it 's the memory may still there , in fact that we do with memories , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> anything but it was my , well , that our brain power of the spot , no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we could color .
and that you can try out , if you to home <unk> down , something in the future , imagine that 's still not happening is , they are similar information to get things like something , if you go , something to remember , what the past .
and that , you know , but when you are these stories that , that tells the situation round , of time .
then , hey , because it happened , and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever known for these stories behind , more beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a lot of drunks , there was the evening , a situation , there was the sunset , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we mean , in stopping to do , so if we actually our memory that change , why do we do that does n't take action , i 'll ask them ?
<unk> , when i came down here , has to me my uncle is a picture that , from his hut in switzerland .
a picture , it 's also a very beautiful shack .
it , the image is ' <unk> little bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , he told me , well , there 's the shack <unk> little around , there is ' 'n little bit more grass verge of , there 's a beautiful dog that 's when you take the sun on the alps , this is quite a picture of the shack , not to make .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what bothers me , because , when i think that 's still more fun doing , what i think it 's degree , i think ?
they 've actually make a freedom and in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so they say , that you see the morning , if you just like this can have eyes , which is because this ?
yes . i 've ' bad slept , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me not anymore .
i think it 's vice versa , he made the idea was n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he , germany , came , because his mother in <unk> remained and he 's what they just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he , every night with the son down , and has said , has been wondering , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , use in the time , and then he 's going to tell you can make it , it <unk> make it , it just tell you can make , which is great happened .
and , within two weeks ago , about it on the son was doing .
and then it was also , ok , that -- that is that is yes , back to visit .
and the is today , that 's at all the youth about being done with the answers , is one of the <unk> people that i know .
it so there are not the memories , because , in the , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we do it around , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thoughts <unk> or say , that was today , now ow , that 's so , <unk> that practice , but i really not , then they make it 's , like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> into the movie , it 's got this , that these <unk> computer , where he did the files <unk> <unk> , do it 's also , they looking for her image that <unk> have this , well , not , so you have a have to tell you , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , indeed zack , the way that .
what ham , we because <unk> ' , ah , is a , look over time , <unk> , yes , that has to me <unk> ' real , like , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then they take that , with .
they take that , in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if you know somebody <unk> following , <unk> , whether it 's <unk> their your boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , and they <unk> .
so , take it 's the image , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let them in the background horses jump , they laugh , why are you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and they can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so , right ?
no , i think about our brain has been so much capacity to make it all that can .
it does , but nothing , because we can be free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important , we make an event , a memory , an idea to rate , it comes on us .
my plea in you , you , they play with the images in your mind , they use the power of man and they give him every day <unk> , their lives now .
yes , the good afternoon .
thank you for the references .
if i 'm going on a party asks me , what i was so in my spare time doing , and telling me to come together with friends , a <unk> <unk> and so , then i see shining eyes and in the head of my audience , and the <unk> of those dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> that it , the film festival in a film festival , classical music is , then we say , of those dancing crowds of the old people , in the right now , long <unk> in <unk> with sit and very focused on the art listening .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and that wrong way , it as well , what we do .
so they still a glimpse of getting , which i 'll talk , i put them a short film with them .
a film .
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that 's my view , the best on the point .
since <unk> grows that <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different .
we makers are today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle , the end of two decades old and i have very early in our youth experienced , which is an incredible force and joy of us that classical music <unk> .
we have , but also seen that the conventions of the <unk> and the <unk> us , because some time , well , a little spoiled it can .
and we are the permanent belief that 's called the crisis , the classical music , not at the content , so , the music itself , but at their <unk> is .
so we think about the question , how we can be a <unk> create the music , the near that are friends and this force , again , there , so that we pay so , you 'd like .
how we can be a <unk> organizing , that infects the conventions of the <unk> work ?
we put the parameter that you from the classic concert will know , the room , light , the context , basically in the question .
we take for instance , in the relationship between the audience , and musicians .
usually , there 's between the stage and the audience a gulf .
we 're trying to the food up .
here you 're a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians sitting in the audience , drink beer , having , in the breaks down with the audience , standing on to play , two pieces , so , again in the audience .
this is the course at a little <unk> .
everybody , like it has <unk> , come on the stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert and it 's so that you 're going on the more or less comfortable , permanent chairs , like you here , and to jump forward , we look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we 've thought , which made , as you do that are .
if you do n't sit and to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , hear them automatically differently .
still going to come to the concert does n't a stage , but whether or four stages the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so i was sitting at the night every once in the front row .
to us is that we 're not just any <unk> do , but that we kind of the music of thinking .
that we 're so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the minds of the human needs the music that it 's so that can see how they are supposed to ?
and that then at night to <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> that 's really only from <unk> lit up , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can make music alive to make and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years with the <unk> work together , with us dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop a , not actually , dance has been written .
and that then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven or for <unk> by steve rich .
and in this year we 've got one , that if you want to <unk> too .
we have the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has all , and that works , because we have a big <unk> had , in this piece supported by .
we have about a <unk> much money from people from the germans go back , so that we do it into could .
there is this film festival something that came from a community turned out of structure .
we 're totally happy in a lot of <unk> in the small <unk> a home , and i have them .
the city is just as big that we really great spaces and exciting place for at finding , but also that small that we have to be .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> from , europe in the city are , then drops on just that in the city , more people with <unk> around , usually .
the film festival is volunteering organized .
we makers are a colorful characters in front of students and students , medical professionals , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or did , and funding in the eye , you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for a year for compulsory tasks are .
it 's also volunteering , but you care , for a year , so that , for the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in a permanent hands are and to the film festival organized .
we do that all in our time , and live in all of germany .
that means the worst part of labor of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , make sure we all over the year and distributed to a city weekend , we make , to talk about the , or other problems that appeared are , and caring for this is also interpersonal each other thing that is just this is important , if you that in the movement to keep going to .
the film festival , even come and then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers , the first to the for a few days or a few weeks , their hands of being and there is where the help it 's going to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days , the way that .
now you could mean , so you have anything else you for this is a film festival needs .
but our <unk> is that .
we have is in <unk> in the city and a community , we built around , well , which of on what we want to do .
that goes from the classic <unk> off , that goes , but also about very practical things , for example , for , because we have a baker , the us with bread <unk> or a <unk> , let 's fresh food to a lot .
that <unk> is in a overwhelming—it in the city and over the year , and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series of individuals found , their living available to ask , with the musicians and samples .
and this and it 's the film festival to enable in this city has become and from the people in this city .
they identify , in a very special kind of the way with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we began to thank <unk> support of the citizens , in a <unk> launched in a call that now the entire endeavor on a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers in the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we are incredibly happy about that , europe , young musicians music in your hand , and home in fact , in the cities <unk> hold .
if you , and now i still not that really can imagine , it feels , classical music is supposed to experience then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you actually , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learning .
you just think that 's favor .
you heard about this to learn or to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn about it , a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , with an experience , <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i made of art and culture learned to have , well , because i can get lots of course , to say , because now . ar suggesting <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i thought that maybe it really would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> still going to give , what my lecture <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've now , this laughter .
you get , the laughter , though most of the saying that you know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word . if something <unk> , what we 're not that really means we can .
art , that we say , sometimes , that 's a bit .
to work we say that 's that 's a bit .
sometimes it .
the people , like to work , this is to me .
but at work , i think we 're more of the <unk> and in the art , rather , the rich beyond the everyday , where we 're in moving , our experience collecting , our own thoughts that .
and so i had my life , i do you now you want to , in about three hours in five to move into a split , all the headline have , with one was starting to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , then go further , the word <unk> i 'm afterwards , why i think that for my <unk> taken this .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life and finally , fifth , positive identification .
intense of them that 's going to these pieces of <unk> sebastian gets you know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn it in the first two , three years , you 've done reasonably practice , and i have an example , if you .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little pieces and she said , on the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , at home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there is a melody played and the other voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in art that it really succeeds , and if it 's only two , who are , <unk> together , together to think if that 's the present , the future , the past , is , works , images , in <unk> , in your plays , things that <unk> are , in the moment to bring together , the art makes me .
and i 've been with them , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , in the <unk> <unk> , at to play , each of , but to hear that one to illustrate that do n't .
so that was , what i think it 's got to have , one of .
a another experience , i 've never forget , and i was the worry about that 's me today , maybe this , go to be .
i have the piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the middle <unk> i came out .
i did it .
i told her .
so again , the start , and at the same place , i did , again , not on .
the audience has more sweated almost as i , because i went in all alone on my place , i brought my notes , put them , and the third time , the beginning .
and they do n't think , like the me <unk> have behind .
but that was a very tough experience .
perhaps that was also a lot of experiences , where i then you know , well , with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> , should i may not my spent go here , because that you can be easier cheating .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i mean , <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want to you tell stories .
when i then this <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and she told him , rather mr. <unk> , i 'd like a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
because you have to create a lot of coffee , going to have and a lot of experience with women raised .
now imagine you , every time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , so a sentence .
and i sort of course not forget .
and from , i sort of course , more adept at .
now i was the way too . '' and every time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember , a situation that i do that never more experienced this .
it was being <unk> of dress of chopin and now i 'm going to the part of work , i have a moment in just do n't control , and it was with the most beautiful place , as you had the poor do , and then went out that back together and again , apart .
i could it now , not long ago , is not a piano here , and i could it 's not anymore .
i have this job in two decades , 30 times a row , and ground and suddenly , you right .
and i then they keep playing and <unk> , i was in a ecstasy and she said , and i just , let me to suddenly on the ground quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to finish , not taken , and the music has this with me this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also , to work that you 're in this had been get , in this condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where everything from ourselves , it .
we had this situation , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we had the <unk> made , the only two months taken , where you usually a half years , i 'd need .
now , that my unsighted experience with the piano , with the art , with an artistic work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first one more than musicians out , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> playing , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given , and have taught me , so , it next to my <unk> for the music to engage and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , breathing , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience that i was very , on their sex .
and a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> gone am , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this idea came , this , this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> , just in the <unk> entered , politics and law school , a job .
because the art culture , to get there , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would you , not saying <unk> , but rather than <unk> to move forward and they continue to be done .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , and i did , and from , i 've always more with this question about me , what you can do anything to art to the framework for art to improve to a management , a good number of building ?
and that was the reason , why i actually , stop , in my professional lives , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .
but it was n't take a <unk> , and this phase , i mean , <unk> with the interaction .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i 'm in <unk> born was , it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about my pet when i think , i got this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
that was i 'd rather something that i 'm not so the privilege of have , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture that lived in those of people in this in this <unk> device the <unk> .
once the carnivale on us was coming , were all in a very different situation , in a very different states .
and i then with <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague was , then we have always for the <unk> tonight music made , he guitar , i piano , somebody else has to singing and she said , for example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> made , so , but of course , that the <unk> <unk> , for months , if you .
and this carnivale , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny to the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> did n't start with that the wall fell .
i woke up the next day , i was oral examination , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
have taught me , quickly , it comes for , on any questions , <unk> .
and growth . '' because i was <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and it 's where i again , you know , at how they 're going to be between two german cultures .
actually talk to the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was a wonderful and she said , but things became <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale was n't it from the people all of yourself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i do when a beautiful addition , it felt , here to experience as the german identity , that i get after time , back , slowly , very broken , and the german <unk> then these two states , connecting .
since is germany , <unk> .
since is also on the federal much more <unk> placed .
and interaction , i then , but of all things here 's so , and i know , in the city food .
we 've learned from the first place that i had actually a <unk> , you imagine that time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for a culture and play .
i have the still .
and play for was <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for a culture and <unk> .
i was looking at the first of the <unk> .
so i have time , not so much so , was that 's wonderful to deliver those <unk> , but they have disappeared soon , because i then for education in charge , and so alliances to education do and they could .
we have very much for the color actually done , we have the what if it 's this analog between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to see what we are there is designed to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture of it can , the <unk> to <unk> at the blue one of stones .
many , interactions , we were and i could make and i experienced , and the time , what this , if a different people from different areas , a target track .
they memorize the way that i became more and <unk> of the art , more and the culture , which is , the scientific unifying between people , between cultures , between communities , better , in the view , and i come , but after the art .
at this was also then the <unk> topic that when we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea , the tithing january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> europe , for .
but that last chapter that is a fifth chapter one has yet the headline identification .
this word , yes , two meanings , one , i either me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i could it , as verb use and say , i either on something that means , i know something .
and that is always in its <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i either you , or the or that community .
and i either me with something , when i 'm going to any <unk> and say , that you wanted to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very large who 's been .
five billion point three million people trying to move , <unk> cities , identify the double , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as large , we have it , then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big covered life and yet , at least a common language to talk , although <unk> nations are here and this was our frontier of identification , to -- in the people and of course , too much ride .
in the signs of those <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
a experience of the <unk> . i have not so many people around .
there ham has <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and young students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letters of people , young men , from <unk> to play the data , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last four letters to have written .
and it was already a special effect that young girl letters of young <unk> up and young russians and then letters of young men from germany in a running german .
and there sits down , and one of young men , in the piano , and he played this <unk> , i 'm so loved .
and , oh , who 's coming from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him , looking at home , as young german , he was , and i ca n't even more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers are choosing <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger with a <unk> , sat down , again , in the piano in a play on <unk> carl and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it did n't show him .
it was for me that 's a <unk> scene , that i want to jump forward off , i am , i said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together to move anything can , but of all things we 've learned that we sixties years in <unk> in peace life and the culture that connects to do n't even more than the minds go , because we have different languages to us to each one of us , inside of feeling .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it goes to learn not just about , something to know .
it goes to learn , so , something to learn and <unk> won .
and if we 're much up and this happen , <unk> , if we do it does n't tolerate that we inspire and let 's kind of art and culture , our own position to relate to the conversation with the artwork , if we interact and finally , our own identity and tried to work , and we faced with art and culture and ask , let me , then we all have won
and i hope that they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they are those profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait for the first picture that matter .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory here 's a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's why , one direction and find me with a theme through , where i think that 's going to the next few years to be working .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you that , what ted , i mean , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk about an arbitrary .
and then i was still have heard that you 're going to talk , in english , i think we should , if somehow possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand what to in english to say , i was not directly , as i thought it to say , and so , what i talk , then , but on the german left .
how we will die .
i have to them because the first of <unk> tell you .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , in that i think of the <unk> <unk> , and i was down .
it was about nine-tenths of years old and has always like in the may dance , because it ends , her husband reminded , the first man , in war by it was then .
and this is it every year for the first , may be able to dance , you go and has been a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot to finish , and then is down and has , here on the right-hand side , you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years before it was also , even slow down and , did on the same way , with equal occasion , and well , even the left leg gets broken .
and i was also , there , as a physician and have experienced , weeks of patients in that we look , with antibiotics that was treated , also been , and have the discussion around , as i was , is because that sense ?
it makes no sense , held in this old people like intense , it is to use to earth ?
so really is , to <unk> , in weeks , like this is a people at all <unk> ?
and it 's then cured .
five years later i 'm going to the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and , i can all know , because he just so rare is , indeed , the time , then , and , the dance in the may be back the other leg gets broken .
so it , the question , what <unk> i think it 's actually , when i talk about , like a human for , decide what to say , what he was in his directives , or what he ends , <unk> which ?
and that 's a topic that the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> the called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to be a report on the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization , very strong that went to be so you ask , how it 's going to go , connected to work ?
this , then , and it in this book is also , you read , just said , it 's a quality of coming , so that the parts , together .
it 's an idea is the work in front , it will also the work , a lot more you 're going to be the example , china , this was a big issue .
and that 's actually , that come to basically the work of the individual , so something is exactly , something to paint , and lower ending was that he 's always more control , of the quality , he delivers , of the accuracy .
and that , holding my prior assessment , the people 's a lot less and self-confidence , from their work to draw you could and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about , and the high <unk> to reach , and not more about , through his work , to define .
and if we do this now that into the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's obviously this is an evolution .
if you the tv , listen , what doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most lament , you 're doing it in the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when she 's nothing to document , what you has done , so it <unk> is going to make it does that 's going , and if not going to document is , and says the health service , just as well , these care or those medical pay , we do n't .
and by these documentary , but the work <unk> always stronger <unk> and more and this , this idea that you 're his work too , and with the use of personal belief six-trillion-dollar , the background , so a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now , from holland gone , because he showed this is n't even more wanted to the had a <unk> practice , the up , is , from holland went to the doctor for <unk> .
the <unk> are in these are most of a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced that are more and old people swing between the nursing , the hospital , well , and back , because the <unk> not more you know , what they should do if it 's the people got to the street .
and then , the hospital , the to be restored to go back in my senior home , or a nursing , and be there on those .
and this family , did you know about , if it 's something that difficulties in the netherlands , there , then i want to be there tends to identify and let me to stand here to promote , that you go out of this cycle of the <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in the netherlands , which had it , these brain , after he 's the language with a lot of them had learned that there , the same thing happens , what the <unk> happened .
it will also trying to die is a quality of .
it 's not anymore , the credibility that counts , but you put even in a very , i want to the example , not be , or not the hospital , if i was in a nursing am .
and then they do that <unk> .
in the netherlands , it 's so , the third days to find a conversation with the bother instead , and the need to then , an issue , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , when i 'm doing something happened .
so just like to the , i want to be or i do n't want to be .
this data , then , a central and there is this type of <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and so then the decision in the basis .

and that has been my friend now , there in holland -- is , also very much <unk> , and it with us to .
in the past it 's so that <unk> today about their sixties until seventy percent of people do n't even more home , and die , but in hospitals , institutions , and that these institutions that i just as well , so you do that as well , not the ideal habitat are for the old people , but it 's often a tightly financially tightly <unk> scope , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding and of , this <unk> figure out there , holding my perception , just limited .
there 's quite homes that 's very good about , there 's very <unk> people that , there are , but if i look at the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so roughly five , six , perhaps from <unk> to us so , then i would for me say , it is hard , and getting and his inner self-worth unsustainable .
the entire course , has <unk> reasons that 's clearly , this whole quality , this kind of it 's why we introduced , because the past the money for it 's not enough , that all humans optimal , and in the way of those are and that people , the care for good , or the medical performances that we 're paid that they say , there was -- i went well , right , because i can kind of , as caregivers a family of feed , or two children .
this is simply not the fact , but you need to two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it , just below .
this is the quality control , as a result of constantly up the market , you bring governance to spray it , so , on the individuals affected .
and now i 'm going to how to the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the past , because i mean , why do n't ask for himself , and this , so , it 's the situation for affected .
and i simply time that <unk> <unk> and the article on one of me , there <unk> , because i think that 's a society is always like this structure , and legal structure , which we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article on one is just that would be the people 's untouchable .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top of the task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes missing , is still a third set in there is that is that every single , neither , the commission should have , he was going to protect and to defend .
because it a way is themselves , to be free from this case , i give it 's another way , and the supposed to me , and so , and feed , and then i need that i have no idea about making , i mean , even die .
because the past , it is yes , so , we have this subject does n't like to ask , we are some of the point .
hopefully , first time , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say , that 's wishes to each and i want , about , but eventually , will play , the subject to ask me to , and if it may be so far is , or , just to having <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be to say , i 'm thinking about this question now , thinking .
so if you think about , what does mean , i 'd like , then you going on the dots are , then the last out , what are because actually the five of things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what 's pretty en <unk> .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , i have to do i go and they can that you know me and the me through the living with , it are the <unk> .
it 's quite sure that trust between people to do i may also related to have , in <unk> or in the actual area , or a pastor or a <unk> or you with other people , with that i put in the relationship , learn .
and it are there 's a lot of one of course , there <unk> , i 'm going to the right now , not all through .

and then , then , another factor that we used to a certain dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i did this time , so as a text , or as well , as an example of this .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , what 's <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be up of us to come out .
so it 's not the question , what are because other to me to do , who 's going to me , power , for babies , or , for me , in fact , who goes on me to be ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to be asking where i can on the people want , where you can i can make and by my inner would be able to come with these questions that can and i was there , position and make it .
and if you and says , how we work , so these inside the quality of us , put it was , it 's a way , to say , how i took me about my my inner dignity , this mechanism to get away .
because no man can tell me <unk> , i find ourselves , because you see , and position to .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or out that would say , you have to now a directives out and because you already that old , me , kind of you , if you should be brought you want to see if you on a neonatal intensive want .
these questions that i can be in the last only to have a long <unk> probably <unk> frontier .
this was the people 's an inner posture , in me is , and that 's not , though they can be that the state , it can protect , as a law , not , and that i also other people <unk> to me and more <unk> , when i 'm just there was have done with that i asked myself have to have , so that 's also know , what i was for a person , i am .
and to those conversations to lead , it 's spaces , and i think , and so i have this talk about this is called , and here , over years , are these spaces like this <unk> in the food , that i put them here , both to go on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we all over these topics are thinking to , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt this is that it may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old are , it can say , oh yeah , so a dance in the may , despite my may very high ages , that would be , what .
thank you to welcome to your attention .
these beautiful good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to go , is , you think , a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
that 's stupid , not , can be before .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is infinite enough ?
yes !
that 's not , this one of this is , what 's always !
so , in fact , but i 'll make it , for the , you know it .
and that we do n't .
we have about us with just by one .
and i frontier that would like a little too . '' to a finite .
<unk> , finite , we know , are beginning to form , we need to know .
and it goes to the <unk> the magnitude of them .
if we 're in a finite traveling are , and if you just two <unk> , in the one example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , now , we need to look in the box in the number is small , it are three chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking , in lots of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we 're doing it ?
that means we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , at three chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
very good .
this works in a finite wonderful , it 's also in large numbers , though it sucks .
but it .
how do you still counting ?
how can still going to check that 's so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i realized chairs and people , and not what else .
<unk> let me !
it 's called mate .
you very well , that it 's obvious , not , we 're now the ground the way , and understand that all .
not , that 's very good .
so , it 's called , too much advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , the way , the next <unk> , everything is basically , different people get different chairs , not a chair stays empty and the amount of these are the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how can we have two infinite amount of each giving it ?
we 'd say , the one is that big or more or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would be back to .
alright , it 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite for a lot to start to count , i 'd let 's just say , they do n't come to another .
<unk> , forever , is clear , <unk> ?
so , what 's hear ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had , but that 's really started .
they mate .
so , now we look at the time .
and guess , and guess is the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is this , you make it .
if i said , for the <unk> take , those numbers , <unk> , we scientist who need the next to the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have , we say , a piece of this <unk> and take from a piece of the infinity in many <unk> pay a way .
and there are able to the right the numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> on the infinite number of a long band , the natural numbers , but the bottom of a band missing the <unk> , on the other people are the line , and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the field of g , the straight to pay , we call the other kinds of n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
this is , g powerful , it 's bigger than n , the same or smaller ?
the same ?
but this is a lot of handling , of on a missing , the <unk> .
who have a different estimate . '' ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , the , yes , really do n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yes , not be , yeah ?
you ca : yes , not going to do n't support , bigger , that 's not yet , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you also suspected that is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm explaining why the amount of the same .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural of , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two of it 's two , zero , one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that 's also turn back , it 's has doubled , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and it 's clear , through the <unk> we do it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight on the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are the way , and the band is still in a long .
that 's only in the infinite .
so if you some explain , what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , which is because forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property that 's in a finite it 's not and this is , is an absolute <unk> , a real subset of the way that big is .
that 's make them in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's only still a great , and that were , three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
this is no seemingly ?
okay .
and then we do we still a second part , the odds .
the professionals , -- the odds .
i did this is what brought .
with this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , that on , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i think there something hidden , i hope that you have a 's not heard .
and they should now why do n't know .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind a boca , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate , c .
who still has one another idea ?
a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going to <unk> , b has been missing , not , you 'll hear the fact , never , <unk> ?
this is right .
it 's completely matter , so they have to do n't mean , the three letters to fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance that it has always have been , is yes , they only at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's up .
<unk> , that , anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it is , and the best guess , and i appreciate that , or how and you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm now , the game of what i now , now , <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show , behind the it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if you 're now , b , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not behind b .
then there 's yes , a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , one of out .
but i have to my , that 's <unk> , in the second round and go .
so i can just an open , behind the way that 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the -- the odds , under the condition here has remained , under the condition that point b is open , is , and it 's not one is , you have now your last chance , to guess .
you can now in a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now that , what they want .
or they say , i 'm c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is , now i know , it 's behind c .
or , but , god is , thanks to b is open , i had been is , i always wanted to a to stay , this is it .
or they 're going to say that 's quite <unk> , we have , <unk> , the way , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to or to stay .
what you mean ?
it is n't matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very good .
why it 's why it 's <unk> ?
yes , yes , it 's wrong .
it , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> were saying , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , it 's very <unk> , yeah .
that get all sorts between , i do n't , six and , i ca n't sixties years , you can i 'll do n't even more part , <unk> ?
so , it to get really everyone .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third behind a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds of them in the dirt .
that would you can on two doors , guess , not , it is yes , in <unk> do , you ca : yes , two dozen put them , you 're doing it , <unk> , if you see the zero , leaving , that 's easy , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , is now , here , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so what 's the two thirds here , but it 's just behind a door of !
behind the onus is a 's not .
so , which is then more likely ?
no way , i am i really hidden !
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to ?
now it is simply , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now , not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got a little better .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope that it was for everybody what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here in front of this is no diet and bad food and overweight people coming , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i whistle , my best thing that after all the way is , these impressions .
i come , because of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 was actually not a mcdonald 's .
that time , who , right .
yeah .
thank you for the references today .
i 'm here in the near up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to be asking whether i do the ted , the lake up to go and over a particular subject to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : the theme of trust .
now , you motivation is also not bad , and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , that has said , maybe the power of a or another afterwards , sports .
if only i also full of this .
so tonight is the rain , jogging to be now <unk> of them , but i have to make tomorrow , they train , because i 'm in three weeks , the <unk> june , <unk> , from <unk> after intended to do with ♫ i 'm a bicycle -- that are <unk> miles .
so i 've left with the rain that do n't run freed up .
so who have a ride to <unk> , go tomorrow early on , in <unk> , i want one dude , they all welcome .
i ' degrees , i said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i was ' started to do , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith , come up afterwards <unk> .
i ' before me just thought about it made , when i <unk> , i 'm going to describe to the right place where i <unk> ?
so , i come from ♫ i 'm village with six houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents on the courtyard , there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what , you make <unk> : beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> , but with me : <unk> and beer .
why i 'm doing , i think of the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really that 's the country , the village , come , and up , i 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> .
and with the other brother , the same way we think there 's like me .
i mean , the look at the light and dark , you can see how i 'll also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light , is , or from .
what is very practical is for the <unk> .
the , we both can actually see , when people of us anything .
'n street , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> street .
the world to the subject of the old men , <unk> .
and to go tapping into .
and what to me , but , it was critical , is obviously , the fact , so you trust and you 'll just this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as a little <unk> situation , the thing i first time .
and that was for my parents definitely that you how many of them , in my brother and i still do n't even blind to know .
we were so the first , then , which suddenly in their lives <unk> .
and then they had from the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant fortunate that my parents than farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and at that the hand to move or to say , there 's <unk> wall , because <unk> you , along and you can , then <unk> feeling , where you <unk> .
a to be the right now -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b ham , our parents in the first of us to them , and then to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the staircases down and <unk> , it 's risk .
there 's the blind brother me then , i 'm <unk> <unk> farm pushed <unk> used in .
the order to the order to what i began to today still .
that 's kind of the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i do we ham , i 'm a courtyard of that it turns out there are done , ma , you could do , for example , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother and excitement started with three years , and then we wanted to say , also -- michael and i .
and then , then started , with <unk> to drive , in many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have the only , i started with <unk> , without .
and then is the big question : how we will get ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents , the children , eventually , again , the bicycle <unk> and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that we 're not permanently where it , drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us have to make , the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , may also a very unfamiliar that stuff , their homes -- that turns out you now , not the way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had in between orient to us that one i think , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now in here i 'm not all of testing , because you will it 's so , according to you do n't actually more of them .
but <unk> ' tonight , if you , let 's light switch off , in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can of time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , by and you 'll notice that 's at us humans as in the bats are also -- they 're a resistance to hear .
so how the bats that with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> will .
and this is for me in the trust , so trust , in the movement , very important to have been .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and i just to orient without a big trouble and now , you also , many accidents , the one or another , there 's obviously already .
what i 'm going to say no pictures anymore , ' , that i 'm very <unk> itself is , one of our <unk> , as children .
because the climb on our higher building on ♫ i 'm farm .
i ' here 's written : the confidence grows , through a <unk> diversity .
and that my ' i 've been very literally , because i 'm a man , much , later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side , too , ' , i 'm talking about one thing i never , or i 've never been so of how i am i have experienced this .
i did , the of it 's never leave you may also be when i read .
so , but when you are also to do with that 's clearly not everybody 's exactly as an experience .
and diversity is the figure out of our strengths with the announcing to regain some point to know where i 'm pretty well , what i talent and where you can i mean that actually also full <unk> ?
and our brother 's all over again , has michael and i 've always took on top of the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
because you come from somewhere i 'm a window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes and then <unk> , michael afterwards , and i was , probably already , i still <unk> little bit like the girl playing : <unk> <unk> , i do n't .
but in the end , who is like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the other , we are , the next generation of young women , here , and she does n't .
and , so i 'm , then , always with .
and then i was , the consequence that we will look at all three <unk> <unk> up there were and the dad , i 'm followers , i 'm <unk> <unk> and do n't even more you know , what he now , to say .
because of trust is one of course , then the way , when others to rule .
if the father , so , to god will to help to help to help , if only , the danger relative size and that one of us , fear tip , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i did n't -- somehow <unk> would be .
it is , but never happened .
he had , then , so <unk> that it 's just said , again , it also <unk> , or johannes <unk> , the us , then returned .
and that was ' i want to me show it 's going to the opportunities .
but now , you do n't worry that 's no value , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me were the different sports , in my life and more important were , all , yes , interesting .
and so , they were all this <unk> , because i just as i could see , where , ' i was so my borders , what are perhaps , so my gifts .
so to <unk> good <unk> like i 've never be able to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , until now not like in <unk> .
i go , until now let me out in the rain .
now , not in five degrees , like the moment .
and in <unk> rain -- but nevertheless , rather than just inside .
but i ' , for me so this faith in my strengths with found that i totally different sports try them , ' .
as the first example , <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , the us in <unk> , has said , ok , we have a noisy <unk> children , but they send ' us <unk> some blind children .
actually about it , yes , because there you pack , anyway , becomes the coats .
and then you notice , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , you know if i was the competition for the place in fact , it 's hard , because then you can be the other perhaps , what do , what i do n't <unk> ' .
so there 's just a way , and this is the faith in my rapidity .
the other into a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find yourself backwards , let it fall , the <unk> head , it 's , and then it 's sitting in the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i 'll figure it 's not try it .
i did it means that i thought , but <unk> .
i think , this is now <unk> little risky .
and i 've also now here 's no volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' already .
okay .
the next to me that was a sports at school , for that then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that have it 's also have taught me as children .
but for me was always in the school , it 's important , how can i take care as much as well , the school to move to my excess energy to get ?
and i was then a way in the school <unk> to do .
and although i really have always thought , that 's all this ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' i now not anymore .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i did , then you find them , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you , condition needs , you need power , a good did , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot , from their work in the society ?
this is what 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just the full faith in the your technology .
if you see the confidence in the own power has -- so the force that you that 's also , then , every conditions , the bad weather , the soft snow , the <unk> snow , on the skiing can make .
and if you in my case you know , faith in the team has .
because when <unk> that do n't see , i 'm obviously wheelchair-bound <unk> <unk> .
and i still is never give <unk> does it 's like today -- i have to the word `` use -- my <unk> -- there 's `` yes , just one -- has already today , my practice .
it , but nothing , we do it yet again .
specifically , i <unk> , you now maybe just last time .
do with a , one , one of you later , a different exercise .
what i find is always do the subject blind faith , is the exercise to the listener , just imagine making it 's like this is , if you do n't see just <unk> to try and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you have two sticks in my hand .
from therefore , now , you , ' i was no one hand anymore , you could i mean , my ' <unk> take and i have the <unk> feel them .
not about .
so i have to me to the way to help .
i then my <unk> in the years ago , i 'm going .
and the told me with the voice , the way .
so the needs to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision of communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me just always <unk> , if it 's <unk> goes , the mechanics tells me <unk> and <unk> , the says , then , the left , 11 , then i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the technology at with the pointer .
when he says , the left on a little sharper left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to go back and or he had to me , i think again , then i know , so , now is what do n't .
and for me is yes , the very large , critical , if the <unk> , i 'm going , then i have to the really completely <unk> to let 's a negative to say .
the janitor 's positive way to say , he 's for me that tool that 's me to , because it 's really , and then quickly to be , and in <unk> also faster than others , in the competition to launch .
and that i can only , when i am i just do , with both arms me <unk> to me <unk> , on a leg to stand and i need to really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open to make , is yes .
and to then this <unk> and to then on the other leg and the way back up and i get to this <unk> slightly in another , but to actually , and quiet .
also with high shoes .
yeah , and this is for me that 's really , when i have to grow <unk> am just : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i tell the guy , because i really only men , as <unk> had to , how do it , just to say , hey , you have to me the right <unk> do , because the right , it : yeah , ourselves .
the idea that not so , what he told me to say .
so i 'm one of him the way for communications , just open to .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs are n't know , it could , i mean , i do n't help , but there , i 'm just wondered , and to say : well , i got ' of you the rate , maybe <unk> <unk> used to be socializing .
or i got ' of you like now , walking , that you just showed me as well , says , how long , the mountain , is , because if we have the <unk> booting up , because you think , some time : now , it has now , but by being .
and the condition , in , like nuts and that thing it on .
and practice , i then we 've also , the pilot , as it 's the walking is , i 'm <unk> forward , i then he says , we have , just 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham recent times <unk> minutes to -- then we are , here , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , very important , there , the population of salt , the <unk> .
i 'm like ' <unk> -- here 's probably the other , also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best of time was already times faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may , i am i honestly said , never been so much faster on how thirty-six .
and in the uncanny today , very <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that we got <unk> only then it possible , when i mean ears , frankly , ' .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he comes to do to see , and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risks perfectly estimate .

so , ' paste them as a blind , not so much , i said -- the <unk> .
because i also , that experience we had to me a <unk> right , and the left to be socializing had .
and then i was in the competition at the bad , because it 's next to the way , three feet <unk> .
and i 'm the three feet just <unk> .
from that -- again , this was -- of course <unk> on .
that i know , because the <unk> must , yes , around , to so <unk> <unk> .
and i do it happening today still permanently , that i got people say , the left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
does the ground , often not so much .
but it , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , and if it 's very quickly go to .
and then it 's natural precision , yes <unk> <unk> tough challenges .
but for me , again , it 's the blind faith that matter , that i think of the risks that you know .
and i must be honest , i am more than anyone , not see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> ' my risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now this is quite all .
the driving <unk> tree , the fall slope down <unk> that you know , and i <unk> ' but of course , and this is yes , that 's important -- i <unk> ' , the good news sites .
the universe is actually , you can be , if that trust that is there .
and if you know somebody has found , because it 's really , a hundred percent of this <unk> , i am i just need .
and so i do so , and these goals , ' .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very key .
you need the same target and i have to leave you actually also clear , what it says , because actually , trust and also gives us ?
because of this is often <unk> faster term , you have time .
i have the or the or my own .
but it 's really is yes , that , too much on .
that you for that you to trust a lot <unk> .
and that you , also -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> got out -- we want <unk> that sense .
and the sense , is very often that we just might also create , 'n target together to achieve .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks , ' i am i 'm going on the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just : i have to me now , who seek , or , i put in the case that can count that i just this mountain , up that i get .
and how do you , then that you 're on the mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , i realized , i 'd say , the giant advantage , i , some things right now we did n't see , if it for instance , beside me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively unknown .
can <unk> advantage to be , it 's heights , which is no problem .
and i was ' , and out of the wooded heights worked , regardless of the <unk> , i came up . and every time , i did , i then that made <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flown , there 's going to associate with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this is already <unk> little <unk> , if you then up there is , and down the cars , it seems to you still not a lot to see , there to know , now , do it hurts , when i <unk> .
and these things are for me , always been quite interesting .
now , you to also the <unk> to have , but the simple , to know , hey , i want to war , the , when i think there are so yes , focus , <unk> and you can just by , but also got a new new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> little bit of the <unk> , because in <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every day , 10 hours ago , well , and it 's just still get to
you go and go and has only still stones in the oil , around , less and plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun -- of years ago i 'm half the first world war in the subject .
so if you <unk> <unk> looks like , is the <unk> about the last the <unk> .
the only then it 's only exciting .
we have the <unk> up of the distance ever seen or the other one you .
from therefore <unk> ' i think it 's <unk> big faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , he and i had .
because i thought , ' : well , so , as i said , because <unk> ' i probably faster , how to the thing , it 's nothing .
but again , it 's for quite <unk> , because you , the <unk> actually now not that 's a lot of change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , yes , something hard .
so if you then in the altitude go and the air thinner .
or if it 's next one off , if you then <unk> small <unk> , where it 's left and right off .
then it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's actually , still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , then at us the <unk> , sometimes , specifically , and now i would he told me to be able to the wire , so he then i was also really in the view , and in the grip .
because i do is the only without <unk> because <unk> and that was him , then , but sometimes to this moment .
that we have this is that i just said , that : well , i can kind of course , she , my friend , the fact that was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' , and we have that before , <unk> .
but i got ' also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently focus to , because , you can imagine , if you on the mountain constantly says <unk> stone , right to focus on one , the left , 11 .
there 's going to eventually <unk> , which is all .
so this is for us faith in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a rope , your backpack attached that i had in my hand , then behind her in the loosely <unk> rope has gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> that i also with <unk> little bit of the height of the stairs them , ' .
and it 's then eventually the only still , with the foot <unk> stone kicked or has with their <unk> <unk> rock on that i 'll also have already know , so on me as usual , and i 'm not permanently just focus had .
and what i looked at the men 's really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , i realized then eventually , because the top towards that you just that goal really so again in the corner , has -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other thing is it , but also that i was when i did , that trust me to come in me , ' that is , those who just because , now if i really <unk> goal , ' as you saw the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trust , just work .
when we then at night , for that the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , very forward and behind us are the other seven in the time and that were always relatively dense behind us and it has been , every now , was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do that 's why this because , everybody that it 's behind us can run ?
at night , you can also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the apparently .
and then , ' i eventually them , oh yeah , right , their faith in their skills that 's been also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the darkness , you go to 12 clock on , then why do n't no light .
this is totally defy , if you <unk> is , the air will be thin , so really only still defy and now , not more <unk> in the first .
and then , but eventually , so the moment , where the , have said : yeah , man , that was really totally , behind you to go , because the friend of me , just showed me all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women , so do .
have all the night of us anything about and the other in the group , right there 's also that the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it is now only <unk> hour , that it 's got me then told .
or i do you know what 's very different now , not the mountain tells us .
and that to know , it 's still be up there , it may also just lousy about <unk> that we 've also be a time talking about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun is coming on .
what these things that is also mirrors , can trust , significantly increase and you can just to contribute to you so the personal medal but just as well done .
and it 's for me faith , then given , and it 's all , then the perfect , if you know that the personal medal and that , what 's really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
and it 's clear , in the sport with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- you know , i actually also not , why that 's an making -- maybe , i did n't want to the value to test , or to look , whether it 's just lead , very is ?
so i think , in some medals that it 's so , in vancouver that were six grams a hard .
if all this real gold would , then <unk> i 'm not here , then i would have on the <unk> , you know , i .
now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but again , i think , the real , why you do it , is more that you can imagine : what i did , i actually been created and how i mean skills and very focused on a point .
like , ' i 'm in me in my skills , but of course , in his team that we all need , whatever , in school , in the job in which one thing , always .
anyway , whether an old man or a young woman , we need to just people , in that we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear , have eyes and that 's also have reached , then that is the best proof that we 're looking at least in a project in our lives that could .
and if you , once you can , you can do it also definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talk , that is , <unk> their beautiful maps .
which i was driving , is the very <unk> effort , the science , and again as a little <unk> in the general population likes to attach .
in basically , i could either be .
if i was in a overwhelming—it <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to science , the <unk> <unk> .
even more than any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the scientific , new collections , somehow get across the whole .
every station has at least a <unk> , where some major issues of the whole .
even , that 's totally <unk> , if you look like , what it , magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a very own off in <unk> , but yet , is this is a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing , that can i 'd like to see that can i 'd like reading , but that that 's me , not themselves .
cool , is cool science , only way , in csi , `` breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in csi as a <unk> five minutes , you do anything with the reality to do , but it 's cool , <unk> ?
there , you can i like one .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is extremely too .
because that 's kind of a little paradox of the future we 'll just manage to these type of technological issues and issues .
but at bay area that none of , it .
i have a few little examples of time i 've been doing , like science , or science , you 're dealing with us that in a given .
well , <unk> , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build the time of being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from top of these facade into very , i think that time provisional out , which is focused , and then somewhere in other that you on a point centre .
this was another big through the press , stood there , just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so you know that this poor <unk> , really long , long saved , there are the <unk> ' time .
there might ask you , so , an architect , has n't that actually sort of time that 's a little , which in physics learned , because i mean , is yes , entirely new , that such a mirror stuff targets .
so , what i found , new , is <unk> , & lt ; of christ , where he supposedly , you are a fleet of an innocent .
there is and i really , what 's the more design or an architect , or where he has studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such a recent issues you have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , this is now , a few years ago , when that just sort of the media came .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at a danger .
the genes that was the gas with green <unk> .
the genes that were kind of what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's situations , where the market farmers are actually become like , hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a debate .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in and i was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and i was totally frustrated , came to home , and my day neighbor , i 'd ask , you see , but it 's happy , which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i try and there 's been three days , so a little gene in my bacteria to transform and it 's all .
so that was , what i 've tried to to explain so it 's a <unk> , gene , i thought , you can see the good lady , when i think of genes are talking to know it certainly , what it says .
so that was , what i actually said , so one particular sequence , i went there in these <unk> <unk> wanted to .
but that was , what the woman to be seen before .
this woman , i 'm never again , the hand shook !
who knows , what i want you <unk> , <unk> ?
the gene is what 's very bad .
this is already now , 10 years ago , and yet , the way in awareness ones .
genes , that 's kind of what we first .
<unk> , i quite a long did n't even more to read .
it 's then , gene from free and it , but really in our language , there 's thought .
<unk> allowed to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different , a lot of other corn , yes , no genes contains .
a different headline , <unk> makes rats to die .
yeah , it was also a headline .
that are , but not that old and it 's also relatively matter , which the level , i would be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , it also not more time .
but this is simply , which insecurity in the population is now , because they simply not with the themes interest .
nevertheless , we must in our future of us with these technologies are .
now i was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but it be about things are and some of what the most really no idea .
and it 's pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , young , energized scientists are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , interactions anything , beautiful and well , and he does is going to think , man , this is , what that interested , but the public .
then to the undercover , the professor go .
the head , decides then , okay , very cool topic , of his name on a <unk> , that 's always important in the science , <unk> .
good idea , i 'm still not the public speaking , it goes to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> thinks , oh great idea , class , because we make a press <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a press left with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's the way out of ivory coast .
this is then <unk> , but , who really ?
now they are institute rarely alone , usually have multiple <unk> as a common that , a shared <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> that really cool projects , then over the <unk> at the magazine , at the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the hope it on and filtered , in ivory up into the really , really cool experiments , then , really want to speak of projects , there in these <unk> come up .
that are out on a magazine that are actually done well , there 's from all there 's free , but who get to this ?
in this just the that , for interest .
in the <unk> we call it 's always the <unk> the <unk> .
so the that , anyway , that interested in the <unk> then , the newspaper , beautiful and good .
as a magazine , the audience , that , for interest , and that maybe about an idea that have , where <unk> about it even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i 've seen it , but really ?
the <unk> , that it anyway , actually .
the way that was now , the otto ordinary , i call it 's mr. <unk> <unk> , under the circumstances of the publications reading , i tried , it 's not to expect to get to do n't really .
yet , again , our future , we will only way up to , if we faced with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> , but not really understand , and over the he sort of going to .
my project , my idea is therefore , unlike anything that we need to this little , young , you get a scientist out of ivory to take , really completely out of normal <unk> to separate , and he 's a course , to do , a seminar how to science , which communicates .
what is mostly it 's going to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know it 's been good twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a unwritten rule , it 's not for his job to ask .
when he 's the mouth does and over his career telling it , he 's <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , to tell you then , what kind of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds , chemically , <unk> , chemically it is almost like the same level as genes .
chemically treated , this is somehow , oh , you do n't know , which is .
the really teaching , along the time , that 's beautiful and well , if you on a conference , and your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want them , you can you 'd like from <unk> tell , but i mean , to say , just water on this .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and the normal to talk ?
i want to school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little more malleable are , the school , i think , `` you get out .
that has for all of use , <unk> , always , and investors , let 's also know , what 's in the <unk> happens .
eventually they 're looking at it by the there are used , so the need to , actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want to them , really a jury sit and that should you 're going to her on a jury , you betcha , <unk> , even worse , let 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and her project really want to rethink , how to really quite normal understandable to communicate ?
so that 's been a lot .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in on each university , of course , but there also get to be in this issue , again , the <unk> .
who drives because , <unk> end of the city in the university at some sunday morning , then , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , it anyway , actually .
because i went back to my <unk> .
so that are the people that , anyway , of interest , there are driving , there , one to get to listen .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> made , all these are satisfied , all these are happy to go to home and this is it .
so you down , i still on a second aspect to say , it 's not in this <unk> from the project .
those scientists are also , trained , wired , actually children ?
because of really illustration have , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children their world to explore , is the same .
so to work , extremely scientifically .
they do anything that we learn from the walk .
they try to say , it work ?
<unk> , falling , no way to do n't work , the next iteration , i change a few parameters , i do it , new .
children learn extremely scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i do to that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that have many illustration .
and , therefore i think , really can work that only , after the <unk> is , and those scientists permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids of kindergarten , from the school , there 's all these are the children , on their <unk> , and , there really do it with , because i believe that the children and the scientists are actually in this is the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , it 's my hope to tell the kids that , at home , and then i get , i also mr. <unk> , then also , for scientific with very interested , because the children with him that tell you .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him a thing that 's <unk> mirror with a <unk> worked , that 's a bread <unk> has that , and paper lit , and understand , and shaking , then you may also the head , architect 's a house can build .
and not just get , i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it right now , that the first <unk> , i 'd have to have said , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject that have just the other priorities .
a scientist to yes , it can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , and i want to meet .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , always , there 's in the next break .
thank you .
i 've gone mad , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks ago was terrible .
the weather that has a couple of this quickly through the calculation .
in seven , soon after eight years i 've been asked , if i 'm here 's take to .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far , up here .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me it was actually more , well , this is <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , that 's actually ridiculous .
i then , but to know who is , and so i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , as high emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , eighteen minutes , a bit of life of <unk> tell you .
i 'm ceos in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company , there 's been twenty years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or eighteen years .
the runs the zeppelin here at the <unk> .
zeppelin .
that 's a picture that i do you here , i want to show the little point , right , that 's really that a red , so a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , exactly this is still going to the size .
there 's that are the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and that are actually just now , 10 to action .
this is also , what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so that 's actually not a market .
that 's also not a niche .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you do that then actually ?
how is this really ?
<unk> in which was , and only 10 to action , because we can afterwards , and talk about why this is .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> , so many of crazy <unk> <unk> the back here 's started .
very short quick .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war around eighteen <unk> into in '' .
then they were in the first world war , <unk> zeppelin died in the way <unk> and <unk> , have been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
that have the london bombarded and so , and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , they do the newspapers <unk> filled with the headline : this time they come up , but not with bombs , but in peaceful intent .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased to because he suddenly realized that 's become , what 's still going to put that old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that was , for the marketing -- a critical .
but nevertheless , it was in london a campaign , except the weather in northern up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much for flying .
and then it has <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> this has taken .
and has a <unk> for that then to america and delivered .
that has a myth being , that all the german nation of course , again something felt , as is <unk> and <unk> that airship has been .
there was the then , in new york receive with a pin .
and the german nation 's got up , <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all about this is inside and this is something that 's a bit of these myth of this device .
but actually are then , until <unk> and <unk> just five , six seven <unk> even still were built and really only two really big , the <unk> zeppelin and the hindenburg , the passengers promoted .
passengers , a hundred , where around <unk> passengers and <unk> , it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then this was at the first broadcast live , these are the crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .
next to the titanic that event that time , where a an icon , one of a product <unk> is , and then also never more after the flight .
and the other devices have been a network .
and <unk> , <unk> the last time , of existing <unk> destroyed .
that the materials that 's used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls mined .
and then i was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , that had the idea , maybe you want to the back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you do it 's a great product has evolved , we can come in this , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may still a moment to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , who has a lot of this point .
there 's many companies , because of corporation that way .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion output .
this is a real change the very , the profitable .
there 's a lot of fun .
that i 've got me , believe , here on up to come .
the zeppelin , is really a very regular plane as any other small plane as well , but has , sorry , very spongy inside of a gas , helium 's not hydrogen , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , in the water , and under up , and the <unk> do .
the time now is not there , that in the details to understand .
it looks a zeppelin and so , with a structure .
there 's two types of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
that have the inside -- no structure and that are sort of how balloons in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world was built these are , about four , a kilometer piece .
and it 's only today , as i said , only still <unk> in which was with our own was , so , there 's only still two decades .
this is then the production , if a shell where will .
the left the structure , .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
that space , the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> back then there are the origins .
so it 's one point two million dollars , so a shell .
and is to <unk> , to <unk> , and also has to <unk> , because again and you have to yes , at that if , one of these kids in the more or a hole that 's not going to tear it .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> make and look , whether they 're going on the black holes in control .
and the end looks a airship without the south of like it 's there .
the zeppelin is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you look down here at the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights , about falling , maybe <unk> .
this is very little bit and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that can do to see .
but there 's a different trend , the us at about power and the have i ended up here on .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started in front of <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were sixties percent .
if you see the eight years , eight years , in the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> into something that wants , then you can say at least in these eight years , obviously a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years , the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not by fog .
the way to think , you see is something .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year , has been .
so a picture of that our weather , not just felt , but also statistically , because we make the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , the e.u. , being remade <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a essential part of this program .
i 'll get this morning is just from finland .
that airship here is equipped , is a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we are <unk> in the <unk> between the earth and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t flies , italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many of a hundred <unk> measuring the and analyzed the air out how the , chemically , and on our things that we 're going to the bottom of doing .
there , so i just explain , up there are we 're dealing with the other airship .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want concrete derived from the subject of weather .
that 's so very well .
and here are , a few <unk> .
that airship of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way , the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that they were still never .
i did i 've got there are wonderful , beautiful warm days experienced .
that they were actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to de <unk> than <unk> diamond for , better told volcanoes for the underground are , in their are by erosion , by a million years .
it , this can also ask , is , that 's all over africa , it 's , then a more sense if you need to make sense of questions , for an idea of questions , meaning from the question is it makes sense when we look at the theater at the movie <unk> or blood , that has gone .
because i got time ever wondered , you know what we do it 's really ?
and what do we are there is really ?
the end , we were after two years , i finished .
the ode to actually , not on .
the entire <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then i finished .
and a tornado , the zeppelin the mast , then at that damaged , that he also going down to do .
i was , but not so bad .
we were there 's pretty good insurance , and they were quite a very happy .
that was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to be .
yes , what we do , a very brief <unk> from the from the studied there .
what we do , it goes and just to that 's the complexity , it goes to ask , growth , or do it was .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do speak of course .
we have to the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called aging .
there are , yes , as well , inside , after 10 , to do it again , to be replaced .
we replace on the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a aviation <unk> going to the kind of the germans <unk> and the european oversight by computers will , and the time , even more like <unk> , or as an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and to and also going to get .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to develop ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you think it 's really ?
you go on the market ?
you go further in the ?
and the course we have in my time , try them .
and we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> zeppelin some <unk> suffered , and this bust .
the beginning , on the billboard stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of german population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes , and he , really broke was , the population him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that way , otherwise we were or <unk> i do today anyway , not here and other companies are not there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco with a customer .

both projects are actually failed .
so we also <unk> .
at once we have <unk> won .
because i 'm not a picture that , because we do that <unk> emblem still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> that we like a with a mate , the technology , a new .
and that 's a great success , but at the accept that 's room .
two clients are in basically liquidate had been , because it was .
why did n't it ?
we know it actually already .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america has been known to <unk> the last 30 forty years , the advertising .
the ham people have <unk> , have the airship that have said , i 'd ask , again , again , a <unk> , the power .
there can do they did n't realize that you 're there <unk> can .
and it was actually twice as difficult in marketing is all over to bring : hey , and calls , and that flies .
<unk> goes well .
the pilot into the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but the last year we 've just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same thing once a half million .
this is the bad .
the zeppelin flies <unk> routes here .
it 's the sense , the course , is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we , and she does n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and again and we got about <unk> sold their voucher could have , and people say , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it 's your friends , which , and whom , and up , in the family .
and we 're great 's .
which i , clean up to begin with the mistake that you think we are -- she .
you could still more flights .
we have this is a <unk> the <unk> and we were -- she .
so that is actually also not very much .
we do , advertising .
this is a project has been studying the audi sponsored by .
and audi claimed that , and here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you know , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have , yes , actually enough ads , but the internet has a lot of changes , the <unk> over the launch , because the <unk> anything to control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> that 's why you today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put that <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 percent are active .
so there are then six of 10 .
that means that we 're then the market , if it does one is to control .
and hope , it also again , a future , something that code .
and what the end of david , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he said , answered the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> is beautiful .
do advertising , we also .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , which has a technological value .
because we have a client .
that 's not be .
it 's <unk> , goes on and the best .
so , so a bid takes years until you can to get .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also very kind of the effect that easy for and hard to control .
anyway , is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so actually not a market .
yet we do it on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
you imagine , just about the question : in what form . we make it on ?
how much money , we give in the market ?
what do what do for this ?
in what form that supposed to do n't be ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm sort of course , my prehistory <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big drag , also <unk> has this little <unk> dead , you want to do it also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace three years <unk> , when i 'm going through vancouver island of people and i am and this whole <unk> forest that have to me , that <unk> , that when i think there . i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , the money , being are and do n't know what they do with what should and almost took it to actually gone .
because they 've got me that , it 's going to <unk> .
and i plan for three years greenpeace was as <unk> and now i do it here in the hope , a future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , is that right ? forty seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points , i went into the eighteen minutes to talk to .
why we are today , from or plenty of ?
how we can come to their ?
and so , what to do ?
what 's what 's hear it 's really ?
we start with our first thing .
the first part is perhaps a little lands .
but it goes , you know , the challenges to show .
a few years , if only ' that 's still more difficult to have realized that , to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know that every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worth , and well , and over time to suggest that are the challenges that growth , for example .
all kinds of <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you see it in a historical long view , you see , the oil for example , it 's a very short episode in the story has been to be .
today , we can not imagine that 's kind of different goes , when that oil and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time the columbian mammoth , we look at the last <unk> years .
it is also <unk> at , <unk> ' i also , right .
and you can say , who needs because the glacier ?
and you can say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you a little bit more with the kind of real challenge to evaluate things that 's really to avoid is , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> , health .
<unk> called it 's a few days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and increasingly further , bad .
it goes , but also the <unk> , in asia .
you think of the himalayas , where the big like this is , and the <unk> of notes on that there with water from the himalayas coming .
it 's the end , not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , there 's been much larger crises .
and <unk> , but it goes to us to the people that , in in a altered ecosystems , very uncomfortable will live .
here 's the loss of biodiversity .
the deserts latitudes .
the water will always less .
this is the aral sea , where a essential part of cotton from .
and all this , where that come from ?
all these bad things , let’s ' i , we depend on the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
so , what we all of the earth , get , what we harvest .
not just the oil and the metals and the minerals , but also the power of resources are is that for renewable , but in the end scarce .
and we should just look at that we 're so little as many of use to also the end , less waste and emissions , to produce .
so it goes around it , that 's in the introduction said already been the entire <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not only c , you two , <unk> from a car on a different , but really different living .
another way to rebuilding economies .
our technology , to change .
if we , just look back the hunters and moving forward , and there 's still on the earth societies , in principle that life , come with a ton of resources , per person , and the year .
in a <unk> , it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five pounds .
we are today 's have to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed on the earth .
it 's in north america , more than with us to us to be more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , look in africa , much less .
and to come , we get rid of the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's basically , that we do it in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the right now , that , but less and like .
and so we 're also the conflict that we see , from <unk> , is , afghanistan , you look at them in the maps of the american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is it 's there 's very colorful , which means , there 's a lot of resources , there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean up to , then we need to begin with the subject of interest .
so we need to change , the ecological limits are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , what we 're here , <unk> lives have this is not <unk> .
that has been the mahatma gandhi up when he said , the world has enough for being the needs , but not for being greed .
and there we are , we 're here in the average life , very much about it .
so .
that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always , according to the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
however , i afterwards , i would say , it 's worth , like this , the way to live , which is more of their .
but it 's always again , you know , from the <unk> <unk> you need , but a rationale , let’s ' i first time .
so , which is actually their ?
and we need to find that we 're in our appears to share the world is so much to have reached economically , socially valued at the quality , at the standard , let 's the average often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you 're certainly , people , not so well , can deal with this story .
i did the time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate change the same cause .
we 're going to a lot , and to do .
this is the one side , we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very much like .
and the other side to try and we do that <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how we can do that define ?
now here 's a a scientific break .
this is also , what i 'd say we have and what i later tell me is scientific , some , but it there 's a drum , how to , first time it is that ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions as it to me about , what i want to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i really , i can kind of participate ?
but just as well , how about it to me , how do , i have to the ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then <unk> ' i have two words pop into that at the spot to work .
this is the needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , our there 's hear you know , feelings .
if we need -- we can , we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are sustainable , or not sustainable .
the needs by se lead , not to <unk> .
what are needs ?
you can be different place in a quote , i 'm here 's only two called .
and there you , the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
for protection , and more , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , for freedom .
it has a little bit about with money to do .
but to a lot of men 's not actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life up .
and there i am in the other important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to think there is to me that needs to meet .
and there 's then , you know , that i can , with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money to hire or a little money you need .
strategies that are you saw my behave like i mean needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i have .
if i 'm a little money , i 've got wind ' i do my needs to try to satisfy as if i said , so much money on the bank account .
it 's first of the <unk> , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and here 's then you know , it with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , it , sustainable , or <unk> .
and if we all the strategies that 's made me to be able to my needs to satisfy to summarize , then we talk about one of the lifestyle .
so .
that was the kind of scientific break .
now , let 's hear you know what we can do now ?
how it 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
now , to that , and everybody for , which i find .
but these are the the individual way on a technological way , here is , you know , i , much , about technology , which has been and finally , on a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , have , i said , the danger is that we , in more and with a lot more and resources .
the end , the quality of back down , because that , the effects , even worse , so , and on us in the end to beat them .
or , whether we do it , there in a different direction , go , with less <unk> , may also with less consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more quality with less <unk> .
there 's a lot of the technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee in the car , the traffic , how can i felt that produce ?
and cement , i can today , not make , i can that house of wood to build et for .
now , with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this is expressed , the <unk> per <unk> , and we 're at the , which is also have time talking to have been is , there 's very deep sense that , and so , companies to look .
where are actually in the needs ?
what kind of services , i can actually meet ?
and how to do with more than a little <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples of that , it can .
in vienna , to a tower be built with two are allowed .
with seven allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that basically , of wood , is .
that you , if you may recognize it in fifty years , it 's no longer need to dissect it and then again in its parts and not so , so , very much less resources of dealing with everything else , you go from there , the moment with the half and the goal is with a fifth of the <unk> , over the whole lifetime of the house and thought , with this one fifth of the <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , as it , like <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows , how hard it in the end is , really from the from the , from the treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want me , you go over the other come after , and then i like , you 're in this in this race inside .
you yourself , like , you 're doing that i quickly hit , and then they do , i was the new .
the nicest <unk> ' i think of the <unk> , that you know of all .
when i do for themselves at that what i did some years ago , we 've still letters started writing .
then , you , wait to the letter back to write ' i ai email , is a massive <unk> .
to write ' i had hundreds of email .
and i can be very much more afford .
this is productivity , this is economic growth , we get it in a back .
but i did n't really time to go .
i have to me in a failure is done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance , where i really , the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , in place .
and with a low <unk> anymore , are able to do .
one of my favorite examples is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling today , it so that ai average person we had in germany , in austria , thousands of things in a household .
you can of time to count .
if you have two years ago , three generations of thousands of things , i had a couple of them .
that have to the manage .
we must have to deal .
and less and people come to realize , with these all options .
and we need a raising the us that helps to the us and <unk> with those few things in the interest .
if only ' you know , i really interesting , maybe is also , ai n't use the spaceship , there 's go , know , ' , i also not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead of having .
a true boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , like , you might twenty years ago in my in alternative circles were evolved .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if you , <unk> thinking .
if you , <unk> thinking .
instead , and business , the easy to work , where do you the things that we already have these beautiful <unk> here , a few hundred years has been built still , you use and still about the other centuries , to use it 's about the end .
that , even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , as a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal that 's take it 's a picture between africa and europe and a one , and the world .
so that all of the with these resources to add it can is only then it possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us has already , and much .
but it 's an important to the economy , the company , these products , these are really available to imagine that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
the final point , that has also something with the big policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention to the predictions reading , it 's been back of the oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week , these predictions again , the bottom <unk> .
it means , a crisis is going on the door , my view , and after the , what we kind of a great deal with economists , we 've talked about , and with that have here are the numbers of austria , you find that , for all countries growth is going to just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason to grow to have the way that as i believe that from my youth , from the 1960 years , you know .
part of that , in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth of fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
that are also , there , where we may be a fifty years were .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder , eight percent complained .
this one percent is still too , so we will be good living .
but you must , like , you put up , that means that could n't even if we are zero percent growth would have , it would be that there are , the next year , that 's a lot of , and consume and income , as in this year .
that we can , and so we can work .
that 's also why do n't recognize that 's wrong , because you these statistics knows that show that growth on a long , not more with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in , we countries , on the state , we are .
and the way , jobs are also without growth possible and this is n't all that we came together , like this tells us and out of <unk> and how they all this suggests is .
so that is simply not and then you must have found , time with the economy of interest .
and it comes out , and increasingly , that , <unk> as a more or the next week , you know , i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with that start on , through .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , the day , nobel peace in his <unk> with being asked myself that he said , the good life , the good economy , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily about the returns to create , not primarily to grow to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for peru , and these countries , indeed , china , for india there 's a very different story .
and this is , only then they are also under <unk> , if we lived there , still growing , let me , and we just like , on this level , on this high level , we 're good to live and economies .
this is it 's also policy .
it takes goals .
it going to say the economists .
it does n't just kind of the growth , but we should actually look , and measure and ask , what about , with the quality , up the beginning to happen ?
this is the down ?
then we 've also our politicians .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how does it , together ?
we need a essentially aspect of which is , the <unk> finally able to tax , and not the work .
who of them in the entrepreneurs under them , but also the employees , you know that very well .
what , to navigate walk away , we know , in a colleague paid .
and that could you very differently .
the resources are , you 're going down and , among the resources taxes , and not the work .
and you have to the end of <unk> <unk> to something like to happen to <unk> to save them , health , without growth .
that goes , but it 's nothing to play , a little bit better .
that conclusion , more or less , all levels of it in this direction , ever be , we can be hard , we can be a company , the right products , and services than consumers , you ask us to do we need , who do that what 's kind of good for us ?
do we need and do we need it might not ?
the policy vote , the framework set .
a couple of evidence , i described .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow is still in the direction , how we can be the growth boost ?
so , but nobody ever done .
if you that the quest to see if you kind of all look at the last two years , it 's always , the bottom , because it 's not about .
the politics , i do n't and the fellow will not growth to create , but this is the question how do we have , to , which is that we have a good life of ?
so , <unk> , do it .
be the <unk> buy you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , your hand , and the end , the spirit , we have to do .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of them , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , although i 'm going on , and on the story that later .
they 're going to have with the citadel <unk> .
this is a <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and so much of this city , which is , and does .
one another story .
it was on a hot summer in reno , nevada .
a man is , once in his shoes that really about that 's really <unk> .
that him to warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does , and then one he pulls the shoe , take a knife <unk> also not a spike in the thing , which is a few times makes them there are many holes in .
he pulls the shoe , there 's actually be knives and we 'll notice he has a new climate , in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the space in the <unk> the billionaires at the mario <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> from , with four letters .
the , or another kind of you know it .
he has the original idea nike even and adidas offered .
both have died .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> it goes on the stock market .
just about today , several thousand employees in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much to the subject of creative problem-solving .
why not something to create , what 's still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what 's an opportunity ?
this question that has to me , often helped , in a tough .
if something wrong fluke is , or my collaborator <unk> me or technology does n't work or what 's also always .
<unk> , small memory , <unk> .
what 's an opportunity ?
and , you get from <unk> into <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the <unk> <unk> collected , which is the <unk> statements of <unk> .
and the evidence to be creative people who can be , if it to their own insurance goes .
i want to a few examples here to show .
that are so in fact that was in the <unk> <unk> and that has it also an ad done .
i <unk> ' the awesome .
my son has the woman 's not <unk> .

or i had the whole day , plants , where when i took the intersection had reached , grew up a sudden , picks up in my field and i was the other car will not see more .
very clearly , who 's one is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> and two , almost died .
because they can see me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last thing i was at the crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is that each other explanation obsolete .
if you know , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all the more of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't have to be like this .
why not things just time i do differently ?
the old things that we do the routine become are , maybe i 've got bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why that 's not just a way to do that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> companies that are using this .
for instance , <unk> that have yet these <unk> from their run up , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there is then maybe something so on .
also a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to stay instead , <unk> .
or that .
we have n't available , <unk> you .
this is yes , today , regular , right ?
if you see the phone , not something you can .
or eat them with me , otherwise starving , we both .
you have , but creative .
so something that it 's .
i only ' one of the client or an environment , then go to and say , okay , that i like .
that <unk> ' i went .
a german <unk> has in the should do the current day <unk> , which is in <unk> .
once the sport , the current news , once in politics .
if you see there 's three on the loo was there is that you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to be a long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> buildings and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs all of hands of business .
it was to look closely .
that have thought , collectively , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
this is to form .
on every table , interrupted <unk> <unk> set fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that , an environment , wait , it to eat their <unk> already , which they 're able to .
just a different .
a creative idea , and maybe with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person is the power , is not just popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and currently <unk> yes , the german trajectory .
and the second day , it 's still monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> , on the month elected , and you know you might say , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the bus are full , it will <unk> run , people together , in the car , because each of course , one of the way , from a boca , b to come .
but why it 's also tend to be something to use and creatively from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> might find out , just like this company , that you might .
so we have , you know that , which is what the <unk> was n't actually goes well , but that they 've done in the <unk> also , saving to do it 's something rather alarming .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece of ourselves from the car , attached to having <unk> it 's right ?
or in <unk> there 's also have to the creative , but to make .
and all that has to do it with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he 'll turn of the left to right , he joy , and i held in the stinking <unk> let’s ' to you , listen to this is yes , not a playground here .
he said to me , looking at me , big eyes , the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that if only , but very much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , if we have our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and so excellence for free , but it relaxed .
that appear to this is that , if a particular day on the week , then it changes , which is in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on a different day .
so one other day , we have , let me .
so the weekend .
that you can hear , yes , already in the media .
on thursday is yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if we then the most beautiful time of the year announced that 's going to the vacation .
what are then the rest of <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's dreadful ?
we 've all this horrible jobs ?
a <unk> did it 's on the front , this topic .
yeah , a monday , you can ' i and the rest of life , you ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social networks is this topic up .
once walking , i 'm going through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i took me , like this .
what we have that in the <unk> , which there 's like this ?
and one day stuck , i think of this business with these signs to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yeah , it is yes , quite a very nice .
so , with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , well , my father of five kids , but i 'm also my work anymore .
yes .
or silently <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset that , there is it becomes , which is increasingly , and always on .
somebody a present time as an answer is the direction posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , ' time shift .
what we 're looking at my job is beautiful ?
this silly is , and so , the pink glasses , is , it looks like everything in a bit of like before .
so something beautiful to talk , does this is beautiful , it 's clearly not .
the pink glasses , this is great to the bicycle drive .
there 's what you a wonderful , the fly , the one else in your eye that would .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
so where is that , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside of <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we have that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running , and running , and there 's now , and eventually it 's going to quickly , this cycle , it hits the poor mouse and you , their out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , you go back in the thing in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie on a acknowledges that <unk> , you may all of them , soft .
that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , because failure and it goes and over again , so there .
and that , what we as funny to think probably has the mouse and eventually , concussion , yeah ?
or something that it 's that <unk> <unk> .
i went , many years ago , so when i kept traveling was about one of students at home .
and suddenly , was , so the street under me , i felt it was very black , my eyes and somehow got to ' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there on ?
he got me and said , no way that 's physically everything in order .
but what you look , with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that test , and i saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow bugging me , the job .
after 20 years in the <unk> and in the first , in the early , wondering whether we 're looking at night before the end you can do .
i also thought , what is it 's really what else , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities to me , to let me to come out with my family <unk> ' , something good for me -- i do .
<unk> ' , whether it 's not a different <unk> there in my job , a new spark .
i was that go to get a large groups that make me , lots of joy .
i 'll ' , as a benign advice and <unk> and also some other things , but those talks impulses that there was going to , so let me share , for me , lots of joy .
and this was n't always like this .
i have to see , to realize that <unk> stress sick power .
and sometimes it 's really this shot of the right , <unk> of me that 's degree back from the hospital had been , after he 's a heart of out , and suddenly , he starts , too , <unk> .
they used as i said , you 're getting with jogging , he 's always impressed me <unk> , you with your running and so .
now , it yourself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in the right <unk> , but eventually we will also in common jogging go .
what ?
in the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve that goes , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the 14.7 last 10 years , <unk> almost minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
the rise of psychiatric disorders , plus & percent .
this is something , where i think , to the way to be ?
why is that ?
it 's just in austria that ?
so , no , in germany , it 's .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all the healthier .
it 's so here on the left side to see it .
it down mental illness in almost plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a german <unk> out .
the number of <unk> five-day-a-week takes to .
and the cost .
and it carefully , all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do this -- sometimes you come up , it , involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so this is good meant .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but again , healthy power and it , and with happiness is ?
and that , i was the last years .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that even though there ?
i figure , the job is not that , which gives us <unk> too , and make you happy to .
there 's many other things that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is , but we used to the most of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , then why not that do that it 's delight over years , and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i want them <unk> ' than the last , for this to <unk> and to <unk> on this .
these little had no , the play , hopefully then easier to realize it .
<unk> is for talent manifestation of freedom and environment .
that is , like <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in the environment , ' i think that , with whom ?
what kind of freedom , ' i 'm here , to do this , what i do to ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , the us <unk> .
ever more of them , more and more stress .
and what i do that ?
the manifestation .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for , which i check .
i had this for me -- by a few years , and i do this is constantly and around .
i can mean talents to use ?
in the environment ?
and that is , sometimes you go , i 'm in a cafe with my laptop , the seminar prepare or a <unk> .
the freedom .
the freedom , i can take to bring that do , what i 'd expect it .
and do i am i also ?
the manifestation .
the last u .
and then there 's and again and people that 's made me tell them , why do n't that goes .
and why that , you very much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer , in place .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have been to the reasons .
and by definition of the spot , this can choose <unk> ' i find ways , `` get ' i find ways , or , ' i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do with our talents ?
each of you have his great <unk> around .
that is yes , far too small .
that 's filled with talent , with the gold , with all , with their skills .
what do that ?
by the end of questions that we imagine .
or if we 're in the hospital , who are or the end of life .
what i started with my talent done ?
the way , who 's like it has on <unk> <unk> , can do afterwards here 's still access .
so , what do with our talents , is so my first question , as well , i find yourself , which is every day .
<unk> ' i think of the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i 'm going to the spot still do .
these fortress was the saving for the <unk> as a shrink five hundred years , the enemies came out .
and the enemies , we realized that these fortress , so well , built was that you do n't take them .
thick walls sixties ways of the <unk> to the fortress , thick doors , <unk> , can see on .
i was <unk> at .
so we thought , this , okay if we do n't get in , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
let 's look like for ' yet that there , goodness .
the <unk> it was from long until the day came , where the supplies of it was .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way to slaughtered to be as the <unk> at the bishop says , bishop give me this <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you been proven , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> away .
suddenly , look down the enemies , how about the wall of the citadel a <unk> pulled it is led , from left to right , and in the early .
well , thinking , the , a <unk> , what is that already .
it 's double-lock .
again , <unk> <unk> , on top of the wall of the citadel , this is it , black .
enemies , thinking , oh , still has two <unk> , it can ' , take .
at night , the same scenario , , this is he knows the <unk> , there , and do is led .
the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they pulled in a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us to be a long , that we hold on myself , not anymore .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had , and the way they <unk> .
that are the <unk> <unk> form .
i like this idea that all right there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
sometimes we 're doing it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also , so we can now , but do something .
we have no idea of the power , we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> , then you have been right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we 're in <unk> know , there is the snow , because it 's getting there 's the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> .
there are blooms eventually come out of these blooms fruit .
there are apple 's very popular strategies that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's the grain of corn , we can then the ground and bread baking .
there are there any animals , the light and eat .
there 's people , then the products that it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
if you , but i think about that you might not so we automatically everything is then it 's a fear and anxious .
and of course , is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very theoretically , but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant play the bees , a very , a role .
there 's research , to show up to <unk> percent of our food , of certain foods we do n't there were when we do n't make bees have happened .
and that sounds like , so <unk> , because it 's normal for us is , and we need bees might also do n't all that sense .
there 's now , some time -- also a very interesting movie , <unk> , to talk .
and i 'm going to them , look at it .
now , but look forward , we went on the lord <unk> , which is just with the bees works , in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees were much power .
that makes it 's look at a school in <unk> and he 's going to us now a lot about his work to tell you .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time , a big thanks to mr. <unk> and at the whole <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something you can think about that live in the bees .
and it 's still under a wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell that is fun .
because i assume you can think that the most of them <unk> in these are it was very well , tonight is a <unk> company goes , eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in order to .
that do i do n't , no .
but maybe you get it to me , you to get that they get these <unk> start to love or a kind of empathy to them to develop and they 're going to engage for this <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect in the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young , i 'm with a wonderful woman married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and i 've been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in a charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> on top of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in the urban beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play by <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is to a <unk> , a quiet , a steady thing .
and it is also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and do n't have been the ancient greeks the relationship between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> known .
and in a wonderful verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> its <unk> to the sleeping poet out to spark that it again , thick .
but the <unk> go there was n't find yourself , but they send their blue bees and <unk> now the poet the lips with wax and we crawl in the mouth into , and out with him later , the words like honey from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully you get me that tonight is .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
and one of <unk> , this <unk> , just now my students with me , have built up for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> into school , or in the <unk> in the college of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms will we had in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied goes up with me in the class , and we 're looking for a animates room for this is a <unk> .
most of the window to the children , that you can see during this month .
and of all things , with the bees , then there are in the hose out and again <unk> can .
there is then the window of the slot .
so .
and then starting to this with me on the <unk> .
i 'm so that in a <unk> and <unk> ' now from an existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you 're now here in these <unk> in .

it matters , we 've got this <unk> their , and here to the edge , fresh their , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey inside .
the need them , if a bad weather is , and do n't you can fly .
so .
it looks like , then .
then there 's the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation of the hard for <unk> spaces , or at the for <unk> place in school .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class , at the experience of crisis .
their people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and that 's the most of the <unk> , when he gave these <unk> makes it to be paying attention to the queen in the old people 's left .
that is not so on these two <unk> auditorium .
and they 're sad , these bees .
you 're beginning , <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen together .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in a night that they are right now the need to a new people to , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without conferences , without having , without opinions and positions .
there is the people , agree and you then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen would that people , six weeks , it 's no longer exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and in this first night , get them from one of <unk> a pin out a fertilized egg , and bring that in these <unk> in .
and there <unk> to then a queen .
everybody , of them <unk> in the high school , says , how to do that go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , is , all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now start seeing something wonderful .
this egg , what 's normally in the <unk> an entirely unlike would have been going to the <unk> a queen .

after it will be fed by an <unk> <unk> .
you know this concept .
and immediately changes , this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> are used by the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , let 's just heard that , what we eat , that determines , what kind of us will .
and in the queen 's really wonderful to experience .
three days , an egg , five days <unk> .
and that can students that all witness .
you see that in class .

no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then count the students eight days , my graduate student knows , three five eight a queen 's so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that , and so you 're going to the teachers that , wrote in the <unk> because <unk> the nightstand in the students in the five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says , the mother , the time , which is because with you go ?
yes , i got to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the , their <unk> down here , <unk> , because they witness want to the queen now <unk> .
and if you that really want to experience then they stop at first thing .
the queen whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then , the <unk> and cut the queen free .
the first , what the queen , they 're looking at their wings , and there are now with their <unk> that people what , i have a queen , who has another through their , her <unk> , their pheromones .
the nation has now , again , an identity .
now are three to five days for the queen fed .
the <unk> forward , get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back , they turn out , leaving the people , because of <unk> .
and after five days , and going to make the queen unheard of the <unk> out .
some people think now , i 've been a time in that 's a <unk> in <unk> .
, to stop .
what 's completely different .
-- that we let me .
the queen of going to run by ourselves without <unk> , without guards , because of <unk> out to two miles up .
you have surely , let 's seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and is there in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so , the like in islam , where the man , different women have to this is the queen , the seven to 12 men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone comes from behind <unk> these queen , and the queen of it now in an flight all that , what they 're going to seed needs to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it a an amazing experience .
if it 's done with the <unk> dies , and falls dead , the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back and starts to lay eggs to put them .
there 's always a , two students in the class , it immediately see .
the also see , the queen .
yes .

and then come to one evening , then you had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> , though , and the next morning <unk> ' i got this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you 're still the queen .
yes .
but then <unk> .
and around , mostly 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now , that people the big and in one .
why bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have experienced , forget that never anymore .
yes .
there is yes , not just like that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together , but the entire school , yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something can , when it 's when he said , there something for it has the can be an era , the other people .
look , bees and a century ago <unk> years , we have a cave , where the people , the honey and it .
a few months , in israel environment , and years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees .
any human culture has with the bees breakup .
or vice versa , the bees were in any culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
so they were doing that .
the human cultures , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know , which flowers , or trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
it turned out there are now , anything you find , and now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the tastings go and flowers plants bees are able to the <unk> them on them , and look , how long need the right now the <unk> to my flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> hold .
how <unk> i have a hexagon ?
yes .
you know if that this is that in the <unk> the top , the top is , or a flat side , the top is ?
let me , right .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can do with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then it comes to the question , how could karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has to the bees can see that in the hive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
that 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> at the university , she has the has in <unk> figured that the bees , there 's a <unk> creating on a single <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax on the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> and deliver , and the bees , the <unk> , the up with their legs , with their <unk> .
and you see what these bees in the school ?
it 's <unk> par <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of the bees .
and develop a mindfulness training for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they get a aware of these creatures that in this just for us humans are .
the bees do wax still not a pounds per people in the year .
in <unk> years , the only way , candles making .
they 're going to the budding out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , <unk> them their people .
and now imagine you , every time ago , in summer , that are sixties -- , <unk> bees on this is a tight space , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious without end .
no , in the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they collect the pollen , and so you to him <unk> , it 's going to this <unk> , one on a <unk> .
someone , at the <unk> have is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now going to a <unk> go and a <unk> dedicated to make , and he 's the <unk> from the people <unk> .
of course , there 's a grid , before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , because they did n't happen .
yeah , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees of course , and we have less apples , if the bees , because they did n't fly would or we would like the chinese are just on the <unk> <unk> and they themselves locally .
there 's much more interrelations .
you look at the <unk> , there on the meadow is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze .
and there 's going into the bee , then , their nectar and fermented these <unk> .
and now there 's the cow , and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and then those the bee 's the most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i still a moment to the point to come <unk> .
my students to be happy , every year when you these <unk> building and then you know , and with me , in the schools and go .
that 's now , not my <unk> , but once i had a student , and i said , in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> ' put you get yourself .
and then he says , yes , i hot ' <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> in <unk> and i 'm twenty years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm , let me that i 'm going to do n't even more with the <unk> learning to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> secondary school .
and more than half of said , oh yeah , it will we also .
my students can see here 's an enormous appreciation and the put between , unquote , the normal and the those people get through the bees salvaged .
on the field with them , and they get self-confidence , my students and a proud .
how you go from the bee ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , how is you to <unk> the <unk> ?
and what i think , i , it 's the human being the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with this .
but at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun across the <unk> feels the way to the flower , and never the direction , you lose the would be the fields in <unk> glory , as a moment he also lived , he 'd ever do n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in god .
welcome to show , my project .
this off my person , and my wife .
it 's the struggle for a lot of the end of female she .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity , because it their for five thousand years .
the society against the women with still , six thousand sacrificing a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
and i <unk> for a <unk> run .
you can do to think that i was the job , not <unk> .
i felt i do n't <unk> .
and so i was glad to me in the subject <unk> good <unk> and exciting actions cross .
for instance , this .
with a massive <unk> over the atlantic ocean of africa , brazil .
on the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil in the demise of genocide in the last live indians from the <unk> , to stop .
that was a ride , where i want more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> than <unk> .
yet we were these large amounts of a match , the interest in the media and find yourself a small person as i was his cause the world to the language into .
<unk> i started with their own caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings , there .
and despite all cruelty , we were , we experienced the other side of the infinite hospitality of the <unk> , into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted , and our two guards , you see here , with their bodies , and they took of us <unk> , and the insulting said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through shooting .
something similar , i know , not another culture .
and then in a young couple years , i 've learned that you islam , it can reduce the terrorism .
also christians are interested in fact , not be reduced on their terrorism .
for instance , the <unk> .
the -- that <unk> .
but rather on the real value , how to charity , social responsibility , the <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years after i was once again in this <unk> historically , along with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then , from this <unk> female-pattern and she .
when i then i heard that nine-tenths of everyday victims <unk> are the rest of these christians and <unk> , ' i thought , from a <unk> like the islam , besides all of terror , that 's still <unk> in the shoes i do so let me ?
and the idea was the highest policy of islam to get the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for expert in german organizations that we have n't found .
because we had to us , then , but now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam is n't <unk> .
you 'd like me to the throat cut .
on <unk> of amnesty , and then we have <unk> our own organization , started .
and they were from <unk> and <unk> independently .
and the right now this battle , even get to have , we needed images .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore i moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to do with the hidden camera , these pictures .
the bad as a bloody pictures that i show you do n't , but i want to the crime out .
girl , the age of four weeks to the wedding are some of their parents and relatives picked , on the earth , put it down , the limbs , and you keep them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> go up with a <unk> the <unk> , without anesthesia , with <unk> instruments , without you of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to attenuate .
what you 've left is an open up from the size of <unk> .
for this is now , a few minutes .
if they typically get you ask him to do these two weeks .
we never destroyed , the body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
that the beginning was the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins 's on .
the man to open it .
he still has never a <unk> woman .
the uncle , he said , oh , ibrahim that 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis with <unk> , and then one or you very hard , through .
and if you do n't it says , is also not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> them on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girl .
that you had three months ago for several .
in shock , the girl its language .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
the most are <unk> governed .
and when , we are muslims asked , why you did this ?
she was the <unk> answer that we need to do that is in the koran .
nothing is in the koran of them , right at the point .
everybody believing <unk> times per day in prayer , one <unk> , the creator , is , perfectly , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , what they were there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women being created , and so , well as <unk> person having could produce , women <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first in this was <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the thing that , the practice is against all rights , the power to religion , we need to him one .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you put africa and the <unk> knows , you know you , just that has to these people valid .
and it was celebrating and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest oppose , the <unk> the country on his message that 's a crime is , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were the way , with your own <unk> .
a hundred <unk> , we had been with .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality experienced .
and when we do this country , they leave to have said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you did n't know , there .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and you have to slow to the thing .
and so , he had an idea .
he said , if you get the ten <unk> muslims , the world , a table to earth and the reason for the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo in the <unk> and -- mosque comparable to the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , his <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he heard , the idea , was thrilled , mostly , when we took him notion that we finance this would .
and that we do it 's about provider , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference is not only <unk> , we 're going to being asked , but i 'm going to the <unk> over .
and that he has done .
over cairo <unk> at the years <unk> our transparent .
international <unk> , on the <unk> the female body through the female .
under the <unk> the <unk> professor doctor ali <unk> .
and all , they 're coming .
a hundred guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe and he 's the cause of the <unk> because of cartoons .
so , men and the life and death can decide .
but it 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
over that in , i <unk> me just still a vacuum , and <unk> personally .
and then i did you all your surroundings .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> from left <unk> from egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of the woman mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the subject , of islam is not <unk> .
we were also -- by the on their way , <unk> , which has to women 's where does , <unk> .
and then you for <unk> your film to show <unk> .
the reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they were doing , back behind the result doors , just two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in the cameras , announced , what you decided to produce .
and the most important set it , that was this .
female she 's a <unk> crimes of the against the highest values of islam and it .
he autograph the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation without our perfect .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is more remained than any mind .
so we have <unk> .
we have that we have the conference documented in that we call the golden rule book .

and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it as well , i found that book , he 's a , blessed .
it 's going to us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had to then conferences have to look at the highest clergy .

unfortunately , but i 've got the most not the courage to put that now , to announce .
over the abdomen , the woman can you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities , you go , on <unk> .

and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that are , the individuals .
that it to spread .
but i 'm going out of time .
it are all of the hot rocks , and so i work , many other strategies , this topic , <unk> .
the practice arguments .
but my <unk> that was this .
i want to the great message of the highest clergy the world to announce the birthplace of islam is here at the kaaba in mecca .
not at this <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there are four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all that , and the seen on the king of my transparent up there 's between the mosque minarets if you .
as i believe that , right there 's been trained to have in the <unk> .
unfortunately , i 've not only , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> he would join .
one thing , to these women to help .
the other to the time to show , which the real value of islam are , instead , constantly going to them .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i think that would n't do then <unk> ' i may have this , which in hamburg , you had .

and we transparent and if you .
and maybe i experience i do it , that little girl his daughters were n't even more <unk> .
then , my life that 's worth it .
and i want to calling , every , this now it has seen or has to join .
and she does n't be part is a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the at a step , otherwise , i kick here from this stage , not .
and now i want to them up with the concept of my <unk> , even show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there , we have it , in german .
female she 's with the koran , and the global ethic of islam incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm actually , so , here .
so we looked at the <unk> from that you a refugee in germany would get .
the <unk> eighth <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first time , so a package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand , why the us now rotten food for granted .
the third day , we finally resolved .
we were going to grow up to the stuff back to throw away , then came a <unk> wife and those that simply against <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
that 's not , well .
it tastes , very well .
it 's cheese .
my mother was the brow up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we have is <unk> , but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china , germany fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i tell ourselves now .
but , it 's going to me about the people that cause to try to have and to a success did .
but first doing , i 'm going to where , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the northwest of china 's life .
and this region is the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> , but in munich is the biggest <unk> community of china .
and these <unk> life , so here because we 're in china under constant warfare suffering .
hundreds of chinese were trying to get after <unk> moved to `` in our own home to a minority become inconsequential .
our own native language , <unk> was out of education is basically .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese taught .
and our religion can we also not free act .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if , somebody brave , is , and for the data on the <unk> in the risk a long sentences torture or even death .
that was also the reason , why my parents , for you 've decided , with us to kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is short of our escape from .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time behind .
i <unk> , let me , many people , in the run have helped .
i <unk> , let me , many images .
i <unk> , let me , but first of <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it 's what is going on me , if i was my eyes <unk> .
he was a big had a <unk> , always and we met him , with his little lada on a lot .
the first rate has been given to .
i know that many of a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business plan to refugees abuse , not for the fates interested .
but i want to ' say , i want to , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> that has conducted months too .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure through the <unk> came out .
the airport in <unk> we came , and i know , as my mother of have to me she 's just turned out of the airport .
what you do n't want to .
until we are out .
because i had this is in my hand , along and there was also my photo inside , but there was a total stranger name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> , let me of <unk> <unk> , i was looking at it 's had my watch out in my hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich came <unk> ' i look at a lot of the first responders , somehow , which turns out .
i <unk> , let me of the <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used by .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least for children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it had a foreign faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> parts .
there was eating , you 've made and done homework .

just my <unk> the <unk> in college , i knew them .
they knew my story , and we went to me , and they took care , to me .
for instance , it brought me to <unk> <unk> what i 'm going to do n't even more to do .
but it helped me , somehow , the kids were able to meet .
i spent my whole puberty in <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
it alone with us to -- without her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had , just a <unk> and they could find any deported .
i <unk> , let me that i 'm very , and aggressive was to the time .
it 's me , slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i have to just to my story .
i was really aggressive and i could tell me in the school at some way to focus .
that brought us to find out to the catholic <unk> where we have the first time to normal children in touch came out .
with a normal my ' i had children , not in a <unk> certainly did .
i <unk> , let me , the <unk> that made me and my brother and so , or <unk> sent .
just so we did some emerge .
i <unk> , let me , several <unk> <unk> , we 've done homework have , because our parents did n't a german , we could .
or that have with us just painting .
we 've always very excited .
i know , how we always the big fence line up and waited until these people came , because , and there , strangers , people for us , and that was telling us at the important .
after two years , finally got my father , germany .
the problem was , but that it directly from <unk> after <unk> deported , because it in munich supposedly is no more for him , there .
i <unk> , let me of the very , who she said that it has managed to my father of the <unk> after china to keep us , they made it even notice that he we had in munich , for .
i <unk> , let me to that time where i really , and then , really happy i was , because after six years <unk> allowed to do we finally in a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally , really a home with a very own bath , and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was a very small and i had no desk inside , but it was very well , i was my door -- something .
and i <unk> , let me to the time , very well used to have , but i had yet , and college without a school , and leave .
i looked for me , really no perspective .
there was a <unk> , to me in <unk> always been supported , and it still going on the idea that i think about the second pushed into my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> roll the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , really , i thought , and i was really not just to the time he managed to it 's actually going to the middle achieve .
and i want to <unk> .
and before i want to <unk> and i played the way with my best friend <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of the organized <unk> .
but i was no good <unk> that , ' i also just done because we 're going through <unk> a place , where we simply could go .
we had a valve , what we need our <unk> <unk> could .
and the director of <unk> helped us some way that we are able to tell you could and he went to us , and i could tell us in all kinds of questions of help .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a school , and the opportunity to get , artistic <unk> .
that 's what i really very well done , and i was , art is something which i was also a little <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> was a filmmaker on us .
he made the movie <unk> over the lives of my friends and me .
and the movie won of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never had had to people 's listening .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more did n't .
i want something comes from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees came to me on the idea , and make a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join me .
but because i put in the bold building totally enveloped me that i did i ended up to be in a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the great is , after a performance of the two editors from <unk> publishing on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i do have just let 's own <unk> to do .
i said , super , the golden rule .
you do , i do with .
and i made for the radio <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , in that i also have <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated .
and i told him , actually won .
by studying , i look at the college , for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and it would have to me to do n't have been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me , used to have .
they have to me , we did you have to me spaces continually open , they have to me ways that , how to my place in society me <unk> can .
and to come , i want to them .
each of you have the way of people like to help the second chance to get , and their lives , or their place in society .
because , the people , in every day come to shrink a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great determination to many terrible hurdles behind , to them .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and for every single one of us as well .
and i could actually a thousand things to tell you what you can do , but because i do n't even more enough time , to have even though there is , a minute , the world , i put them a <unk> brought .
extended , you 're now your cellphone out , you ca n't tell me to tell you have no code <unk> can .
then scan it the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many suggestions , what they have no way we can do .
and that 's very good to help .
i thank me now , time for their commitment , and we look out , i hope .
and then scan it the code .
i just know , it .
many have the phone , not in my hand .

i want , a joke about the <unk> your girlfriend writing , but the punch was just flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
they will let me the same with a <unk> question to start .
why would you <unk> at all do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax used to do to ask , whether it at least some potentially the society , what you back .
the answer is clear .
we know now that the life , at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> .
it 's subject to any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know it still so little ?
why we will bombarded by <unk> messages from the <unk> that , a part of each other on ?
you remember , all of fifteen years to the guilty .
it was fat .
you thought , if you get fat from the food , we , we all have and be healthy old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves with various <unk> in the american way the has led , and what does n't touch it has changed the americans every year 's become inconsequential .
then , you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so has led .
so it 's , a new <unk> sow through a 's a village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste of rice at least that we 're going through <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated and scientific wisdom <unk> .
sort of a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> , you probably all .

the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards was seven years for the number one nominated .
then he died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest person , that ever on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's some people , say , they are six , we can , but now their <unk> does n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> become .
and it stopped with <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> , and then finally , with <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and coming to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not that smoking healthy .
but it tells us that aging , very complicated is , and that we have clean , i need to be simple experimental systems and we need to just might ask questions .
a very simple question , and a very simple thing , in different countries preserved is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
this is the testosterone , the <unk> , what the male <unk> produced is .
and there 's <unk> is very simple evidence for <unk> men are so just as old women .
you can now everybody for , thinking , if that 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria 's a free land .
but it are still better tips , not afraid .
we should we 've got correlation with causality to confuse .
sounds complicated , but it 's just at the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there 's visiting so someone ai <unk> grandma , and asks , what they have , because so different made or another way i had to keep them that old become are ?
ah .
the grandma , every day , cigarettes down .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?


even when they statistics are not always meaningul .
there , for a very hard , the shows that people that <unk> in the <unk> visit the older , when people that 's not do .
do .
this is any rate .
what 's the at the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that the people just enough money in the pocket have to , well , to her age , and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i said , but a group of the lab , <unk> to forage admit , and this group with 20 percent of you live longer than a group of the <unk> it 's not get , but otherwise , the exact same way that was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet affected .
and actually are trying to have been done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very -- at , but even if i do with my enemies , agree , this is that , regular fast at the life going up .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see here , ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we have the fast , in the <unk> line showing then life that were much longer .
the same thing for <unk> , <unk> fly mice and has been , about two years in the u.s. demonstrated that 's even for the monkey is true .
and let 's not about , skinny .
it in <unk> the blazes kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , what the united states has been done .
what did you did here ?
you have a <unk> and has one of this so-called <unk> given , a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night , getting along .
and who to wonder , that they 're dick became , sick and have a very bad <unk> of out and bad <unk> .
now , you have a parallel <unk> and that has the exactly the same number of the <unk> looking at the only that in a break .
that have the day , thinking about food for further , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now is not have and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although both mice <unk> does .
both have a lot eaten .
that a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens is really ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> clicked on .
when , and they organisms , or cells replicating food taken away from then it starts to the organism , redundant ingredients in the cell or those compounds them to make it again , energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , , <unk> form of the junk , the ages <unk> .
the one , then with the stomach that 's going to <unk> and the cell as energy back to put them .
it 'll just damage that the age accumulate in the limits on .
this is quite the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell you .
so , it so , regular said , they spread that live in different organisms .
and it 's likely to take that 's also in people work .
and we learn from this is that it 's not like in <unk> recommended every little <unk> on day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should do to say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , perhaps is under the <unk> clicked on .
welcome you your hunger , as a friend .
and it 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine nine percent of the history has the human being what did , when he hunger had ?
alright , he 's hunting gone .
we go out of the fridge hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe against the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is very weak .
the garden , looking for us very different from .

the three guys here 's good , the food , all day , let me , to serve .
and that 's kind of the actual <unk> .
we 've become so on the quest for all made the molecular answer the <unk> turn on in the organism to eat .
it could get to be interesting to their <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we may , one of the hardest <unk> of being preserve .
the question is so that we can <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds of the thousand substances scans , natural substances .
we 've actually , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a substance , in all these organisms naturally does , but also in all these organisms during the means less will .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells , there , for example , then you see this .
this is a is through the cell here .
this is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the junk , the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells ? what 's exactly like this .
and it works in different organisms .
here for instance , shown on a <unk> .
so we have a substance found that the molecular <unk> tricking the <unk> .
life , because the organisms , so , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see here 's a typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , it 's the days is about half the dead .
when , we <unk> into the water , there , here in colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we kind of <unk> ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we 're starting with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research , as close that even the lives of all over mice by <unk> up .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these animals are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where is <unk> on ?
how the name , says , it 's the sperm discovered was , you get it in very high concentrations .
but i can they did , in <unk> fresh green pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which in japan , big <unk> firstly , it 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we have to us , then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it 's the junk <unk> helps it might also against <unk> ?
they have to find is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we 've actually , experiments that made .
they 're going to wonder , we have the edges of flies have done .
flies to see , but somehow , if you to age .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you to age .
and the molecular mechanisms to the memory of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the fellow and the memory of flies measured ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan seals from the university berlin .
you take a hundred flies and put the here , there are one another , they love .
<unk> .
and let the , in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give them <unk> another one another , they love , which is <unk> .
and we make it the <unk> enjoy , but if you ai <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then take them back into the same fly to do that here in .
the driving this degree in your down , there you that .
and if you down here , which are going to give you off the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> on this .
where you go out of all about to do ?
it .
the <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want , let me , not by this ai <unk> reward corrupt .
okay .
but it 's a form of a character , with the age increases .
not only in fruit flies .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , in the brain that were , again the ground .
that means <unk> does n't just against aging , but also against <unk> diseases , maybe .
and that 's important , because we want , the <unk> not the lifespan by se extend .
it does n't make sense , the era of <unk> to extend .
and i want to do n't you are released , without them , a few practical tips , to do we do we might younger .
, <unk> fast .
it 's not about that you gain weight reduced or so .
there 's the way , now in austria as a group of <unk> people , the one day eats , and one day , do n't eat .
this is that this so-called <unk> under the line of <unk> ludwig and erwin <unk> .
and that the very well , through .
that is , it 's <unk> .
and avoid it <unk> .
it 's not to carbs complex carbs seem to do not too dangerous .
it 's really want to take candy .
you know now that <unk> sufficiently are going to get diabetes in , even then if you have .
and you know , that sugar , the growth of tumors , if it can .
here you ai <unk> , the years ago , to remind you .
after 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose rich .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , it works in almost all of organisms that .
and eat it 's a regular fruit and vegetables .
and avoid it 's the gift of to be much <unk> or from <unk> at all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer , the risk .
this is not under conditions for vitamin d .
we are there might have degrees ' in winter , a <unk> , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin is building .
some that they 're looking at least three times per week , a half hour sports , that 's trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the original <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
they do , in times the eternal <unk> occasionally , the peace .
the impact of pray and blood pressure on the life is to back .
because the monks lives almost all that long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> life is still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that 's what do with some really all business .
no way , no way that 's very simple .
if we now here 's a <unk> the window is then plaster ' i think of the with <unk> <unk> solution away .
and what 's like that 's probably in your around .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what happens to be by drinking under the circumstances , because <unk> .
so , alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or a family , longevity associated with .
they should n't on a lot of the busiest streets live .
now if you see the same <unk> .
that , but with <unk> ai n't have to do .
here 's the <unk> .
you can measure the closer to somebody on a lot of the busiest streets lives , you cut more <unk> he 's the blood .
and it as well , if he says , i was they were used .
i can already well to sleep and the noise , i do n't .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
the sunlight that should i could be because of <unk> of course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
so , it 's the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice against infectious protect .
knew that way our grandmothers also , the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it 's not without any sense .
several charities that really made that dark chocolate against dementia <unk> work .
and just recently is a study with that has shown that a half the board of dark chocolate per day , the <unk> of <unk> on the level of <unk> can make .
the same sorts of what you kind of coffee there 's the <unk> , but thinner .
there 's studies the show , there 's studies that 's not show .
what 's clear , this is that coffee against juvenile diabetes <unk> does and their metabolic performance better .

a very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people fifteen years , and they were have shown that people that every day , a handful of nuts and eat their <unk> to 20 percent down .
this is a huge value for a <unk> study .
and this is for almonds , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for the peanuts and the <unk> that actually beans .
that there 's only , by , you nuts call , okay ?
that are , but actually beans .
so for the peanuts is n't .
the next thing is a little bit .
and avoid it 's the shot of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
a very beautiful new study shows that you , if you in this time to a lot of animal protein to , they take her <unk> so strong increase , as if you a strong smokers would be .
this is not for the time , where the animal proteins are good and it 's true of course not for <unk> children or at the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and people like that it will want .
we do you <unk> .
what and they do , you staying <unk> that i knew already friedrich nietzsche , has said , to say , the <unk> , that 's a mistrust the <unk> are signs of the health .
everything <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about , that regime lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it out of my home <unk> from the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very well .
he 's just not <unk> one-off no anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's one of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i do you today , this .
we should look at all the <unk> experiments ai n't important fact , not overlook .
which is that <unk> the means i 've not an organic , but a social seems to be , and so , a -- it’s .
you <unk> the old people less , and it could get one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel , the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece of the contemporary critic , the adolescents fresh <unk> .
thank you to for your attention .
i want to start with a question that i do you realize it .
a question , where now , no up to , because that 's a little intimacy , who of them is very lonely ?
the anyway , is , very low .
one are still when i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why do n't who have , the people that for , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and i think that would be <unk> .
this is not liking that the case .
you 'll see loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon of people than just to be .
maybe it 's because it also that they 're not who have , because the question here 's a matter .
like to be wondering , lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can , lonely feeling , without lonely .
and you can be lonely being , in the moment lonely to feel .
and loneliness has also a lot of shame .
and this is some now here from have , and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness is in the shame and realize that in loneliness .
and loneliness takes time .
it 's why is , now here 's no one who have the past few seconds , that i put them have this .
and loneliness takes <unk> .
and loneliness to the time to , their own , even aware .
and loneliness also need exercise to talk about .
and this exercise have that we all into action .
we have neither the language , we have any sign of ourselves to see when we are lonely ?
there 's going to loneliness two <unk> , which i do , so i am .
the one part of humanity , you is from the beginning of lonely .
the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go and often to <unk> and drive , the whole day .
i ' no time , is that their <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less nationally , say , everything is with everything connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i do is just a piece of one of the universe .
and there 's the great group , to the and i 'm one of the time that time thinking that .
the thinking , okay , today i am very lonely and the next day , oh , it depends , and it all together .
if we , and loneliness to think of us , first of the very large loneliness back a .
the loneliness to the dying , and loneliness to the person in intensive care .
but over these <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' what i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , and loneliness to us , in this is a theater face .
i want to do n't talk about the burden and <unk> the <unk> .
and loneliness in other things that 's mostly , not difficult loneliness to us to detect <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , in the break a few pictures made , i went to show you .
how easy it 's always falls , in other loneliness to detect .
and we all know , not , whether these people , really in this moment lonely she felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talking together , just to itself is something lost in the corner and has n't want to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know , safe here , all .
may have some of you today , i 've seen .
what you about it does , you put that cell phone in something very often , that could you today , you 're like this is doing that <unk> on the mobile , an escape , the big <unk> .
clearly visible , if you on the display , we look .
what we now this is n't do .
yeah , and then there 's the loneliness to the types of them is the loneliness of <unk> on <unk> stage hundreds of <unk> faces in front of and you yourself to leave the hope that you get its text , not forget .
these are the <unk> that you , though it .
that we are other people on .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room that , from birth of lonely feeling of their entire life for so he spent have , by showing you have tried to these loneliness from , <unk> , to distract .
and there 's in this room , guaranteed , people that are feeling lonely , because it on a different people up to whether it 's because of death , or because of a separation .
there 's using it 's nothing that 's still so many people , people to do you 're connected to move around them are you feel , lonely .
and there 's people that have the relevant to , lost , no contact with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you look at the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who , they think , there 's no , social contact .
it 's always relatively .
there 's not an official number , not an arbitrary number , when someone to human contact , when i do n't .
we cut down there , the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we know , but everybody in cities , connected with very many people at facebook or by twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness bigger and become .
you can do with hundreds of people to be anything , with a single human right to measure .
it 's in the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it in the digital loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often each other <unk> .
that 's also that the analog loneliness is a little grew <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness , well suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of data point that the digital loneliness to the future , you gain is when the ways , connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years , that feeling that the our from loneliness very similar to go , and loneliness to call it .
or whether you for and then a new age of the way .
but that are also , the problems with the successional generation .
almost more than the loneliness itself is the fear of the loneliness and from this fear of the loneliness are people can say to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the story of them , what people do everything , not alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , then again , are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went on the fear of the loneliness to kick out , spend money .
and shop , go .
that 's favor .
both the process over , the loneliness , because it at least in the short , in order , the objects themselves , you acquired by .
only problem is that 's very quickly led to help and the speech , this kind of those potions against the loneliness .
so we need to , new things to buy us to <unk> .
i ' time , the advertising for a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications with the slogan be doing all of it .
what that in my panties to do , you know you do n't , but it works , that .
and loneliness so there 's nothing to the <unk> to do loneliness to figure out of people that instead .

one hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship waking up or the or the other , ( music to see , suddenly terrible alone to feel , terrible lonely to feel and the question to ask , who is this man 's really ?
i did , i want to do something to do ?
a study saying that , the are women across the world , married , with kids , feel .
this record of missing , because i 'd already , not more you know , if i think of the study , even invented , to have so often , ' i do they told .
but it 's also now , whatever , because it at least in studies , whatever is , and the response is always the same is that people , i <unk> .
that intuitively knows that completely obvious thing is , almost a <unk> .

so that little bit about the loneliness to the sex .
this is also has probably already all experienced .
so , while you <unk> is , suddenly to think , what do , here i really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
this is also a form of loneliness that 's not going to have to do with the quality of sexual are about .
and nothing to do have to do with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we talk about the right to do n't about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness also <unk> than we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've been watching a group of five <unk> , better , three on death suit , and two carried costume .
the two men have to talk , the two women in costume designers have to talk .
and in between what was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in my hand of an intern .
i think , i got them the scene do n't turn out on with you that form of loneliness that everybody 's also have time in his workforce has experienced again <unk> can .
it 's the loneliness to the <unk> .
but it 's also the loneliness to the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , in this may also some of their lives to see , <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in become bars , often do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
it 's a form of loneliness , tribes , not talking about how will .
just heard it also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> who can be .
down here is insulation .
i have a <unk> told that he 'd been talking about one of the clients , and the has said , it 's what 's been happening , you can do it tells you do n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , he even to <unk> guy .
and two months later , he 's also on .
the loneliness is n't just so .
it 's always in the connection with other feelings .
it 's nice siblings and it 's ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
of being sad despair anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
the freedom to the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea for you look , the loneliness .
and come and goes in life as the tide , and floods occur .
let them , and let them , not from her up .
because there 's still a much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may , the loneliness comes when you do n't even more to track them .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i 'm so hard about loneliness thought i have , for me two things change .
one thing , in my immediate the <unk> i 'm not even more like a disagreement dictator since i realized , that i only then , who 'd have taught me why it , not raise because i thought i may be recording i think of the people , maybe the wind ' i lonely .
i think it 's been able , since i think of loneliness in my life and what you have more people come and go to them .
so just about the <unk> that you that power .
also because i can become .
people come and go to make , they do n't even more immediately , and millions , whether , from an encounter a friendship , a partnership to do .
as a child i found my parents were incredibly embarrassing .
that can look at any <unk> by , without with somebody a conversation with anybody .
if you at the <unk> or in the economy .
every time to it to an average .
as a child i found that as i was embarrassed .
as young adult , i want you just looking for <unk> that was able to this openness .
but first ever since i even , and loneliness busy , to have to make it to me at least , again , i was also <unk> like to open .
you see it 's very lonely , i mean , willing to do for the performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i ' here , three seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , like , i want you what if it even accessing i 'm sure what it would you take ?
the most would , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort in the largest transformative effect for free .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
because we let the activity , with the largest transformative effect , except for eight and make us to others strategies .
we make us , for example for the <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> , but the big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we make us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> , but still very big effort .
for me , so , not so valuable .
and i want to you today about how they do with the least of effort in the biggest <unk> achieve .
if you , with prevention and health busy , you to a topic , not a drum around .
and the issue is overweight .
and the theme of obesity , was in germany long time , not an issue , so , until the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany , what matters .
and i asked me , what was there on in the <unk> ?
why did n't that soar suddenly , the top ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> become .
because it was right in the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we are over and along ?
and i was going on .
<unk> comes for , germany .
and that obesity is increasing .
and the years <unk> takes the curve , right at the journey on .
and what comes and then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how do all this is .
and we are over and along ?
well , then i was one , and one cleared .
because it was , right .
sports power .
and of course , stuck , i 'm not here today to evaluate them to say that sports dick power .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've now let 's all of the whole .
the tide of , new training -- and <unk> has n't notice that led to be thinner and healthier .
what it 's so then ?
the atkins diet ?
and there 's a very good study from the united states .
and that have the problem with obesity .
and they 've got into the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to do , we look , so what happens is really ?
and they 've seen that people take in fact , less fat , but the people , and fewer calories on , but yet , along .
and that was paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can this for us ?
there must do the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here 's a big <unk> .
and on the one side of it 's a <unk> , i do we all the coals on that would be here you .
and this is the energy <unk> as much electricity .
if we now , but more coals here in there in our power as we 're going to the other side of <unk> , the energy in the power and it took off .
the human body does n't just get off .
the mind , the energy store .
and that is in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here , the energy and then it 's only one thing to .
the <unk> , that drastically reduces .
here 's actually required no life , instead .
we are , only still mobile .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 miles to a fluke .
and we come today degrees , on a to two miles and these are the positive estimates .
there 's studies that report of five -- until <unk> meters .
i <unk> , you this is still a <unk> with my friend mike tell you .
give you to me a degree , the chair ?
mike , you 're likely you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
it 's too shy , he will not talk too much .
and he was back in this trial and it is now .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike eat less and and less and and we know , only still <unk> , and yet it 's over and along .
why ?
because mike 's still sitting .
and i was time i watched , how much movement mike , so the day , and i told him , so one step counter the back in the bag will put them and at night i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that was so the distance that mike at has the morning , the kitchen to the car with the car in the office there , of course of a coffee , and the evening back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike was at that day , 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and its minutes , i was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of alone .
and mike 's not so , dick , because it to be much eats , because long as it up again and energy <unk> , but not waste of he will inevitably , along and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , as you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that 's not there .
the <unk> , eventually back in <unk> blood .
and there is it 's active and <unk> silence , and quiet in his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if , the energy <unk> into the blood , you 're talking about the physicians of high blood and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> there 's like <unk> , it 's all this little black holes in these <unk> .
and a very lucky floating if there are still at the big fat around and that 's placed , now about these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flowing through these tight <unk> pots pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , then on this is a <unk> is , it 's also in the body off .
and if that the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if it in the head happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany dies every second , heart and stroke .
that go in germany dies every second , <unk> .
and also mike 's not so , so sick , because he did n't got to my life , but because it , does n't even more than moving .
and if you find that i do n't know , for you always on in the wrong .
for instance , the subject diet .
i have degrees ' yesterday , diet in the amazon went into and there are environment <unk> <unk> <unk> , right now .
and if each book , just like a centimeter is thick and we would that 's <unk> , if we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there 's inside and now that 's really important as it 's more energy in so more food as they consume and then you be thick .
and if you 're less energy that when they consume and then you be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to the environment , books ?
that 's only one thing to .
the need is huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because , why have failure of diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what do the things that we 're here 's three weeks to make and here 's five weeks , if we then , this struggle , again in the normal life , come back , and to our normal lifestyle .
what we then actually , five or seven weeks ?
nothing .

so they have to do they do today at any new diet , in any new <unk> questions and i want you that in your life , in your lifestyle into .
yes or no ?
and when i mean , then go .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end of anything out , it is that time .
it are the behavior that 's going to decide whether we 're sick , or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , sick .
and it are the good behavior of us healthy .
and if mike in the mirror , look , then he look inside , and the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike in the mirror , we look , then he look inside , and his daily habits .
and if mike in the mirror , look , and frankly , to , is , you see it 's , where it 's the way .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then it 's just said , the way .
and if mike in the way we want to the health direction of its goals , the direction of its dreams , then it needs to do n't immediately his whole life <unk> .
then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a <unk> habits mike 's also a great example of that the human being a weird animal is .
mike 's the example , did , movement has completely from his life <unk> by it every way to the car , you need any using an advantage , every elevator uses .
and the evening , and he <unk> on the couch , and to somehow tying , movement .
so this is he , in its <unk> drives the gym there with the an escalator , the top is yes , by se already paradox is , and will then how much as a rat back on this is a band <unk> , so he somehow , the coming .
and my grandpa did that , just as any as you .
the was a farmer and the have that did n't understand .
the have said , sports is for people that , not move .
and somehow he 's also pretty much .
why we need to the evening , in our precious leisure , that compensate for what we have the ground in shock of ?
being taken , we have today in this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports and make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the back there to find where we do you lose .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i want you today to a perspective invite you .
maybe even know , they also the situation , you drive the evening , quickly to shop , and following , that in the front row no place , free .
and that you see how we 're , so i sort of <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because they go .
we plan our homes and so that we have the <unk> ways .
we 're all of our lives that we have the <unk> ways , but that brings us , but not going , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so we can you do today , the <unk> activate and the back there are finding , where they 've been up .
i check ' for happy to the track .
and i 'm the only , always up and down and up and down there 's now , and everybody else .
but if i mean , it 's because i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement , that 's just like this around the ways .
and when the top of <unk> comes to 30 minutes <unk> , let’s ' i hooray .
environment steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes translation .
and a <unk> environment steps , if you do today , every day environment steps more , then , that means that it is the day , twelve grams fat , not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but as <unk> , as a habit established , let 's <unk> days , then we talk from four point five pounds fat .
that we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are , crazy , put something so here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds fat .
there are n't know , i had four pounds .
just so you might have a look , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this perspective , what you mean , what 's just happened , if you really in a active life on .
and these <unk> that we get them , you do today , every day in your life .
once you in <unk> steps per day , which are going to run it 's almost all prevalent it .
and if you feel like , and i have time in sports and then we do it on top .
then you have to the <unk> also still <unk> .
then they will also , faster and more .
but do with them to your health , not more on the amount of sports .
so they make your health , not more on the amount of like it , and of their time .
because the most important that most important that they 're doing now , every day as much .
and i <unk> ' an active lifestyle <unk> .
and for me is it has gotten more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the lives and for me itself .
because i think , health has n't want to do with , what we should do , or do have to .
but the health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only still an idea for them .
and they have to go from here today , just , for the best .
and go from now you can also how can .
step to step .
thank you .
<unk> as it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually done on this incredible , you see that said , and in the world with others have to see ?
and yet , so far , that engage in what to his time , just simply inconceivable , never thought was ?
we could do this is also ?
that , maybe what do with companies to do ?
and how we can put this force and confidence for our future draw ?
we start , on , with the question what do we actually cause of innovation ?
it .
technology inventions research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
this is yes , all the great .
and we can do with quite proud of this , and to be grateful that we <unk> in that you see are that our technologies around the world to be that 's good to go .
that we do with a bit like this extraordinary , unique prosperity .
but what it with the future of ?
the challenges , because as a society , and told us ?
and who cares , because the big ecological and social challenges ?
so <unk> , it seemed kind of fine .
a kind of labor .
so the same thing , the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort , we then productivity and efficiency .
and that the world better , i want to make the finding , in the nonprofit organization and bring together and citizens ' and the need to actually , what are so if you 're entrepreneurs of course , then the damage the capitalist economy to remove .
at least complex to fix .
but who says , because that we looked at the than that separated at to ?
how about it because if we <unk> to a social and cultural dimension to expand ?
if technological innovation simultaneously , cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovations together , as social innovation are ?
if it 's ever leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution of environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it 's very different kind of the unknown forces <unk> and if it 's even a very different , and fair <unk> to promote ?
because as i was that ?
both sides to have , but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask , you may come .
so far we do this is yes , as a way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh creepy , much does the poverty and <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more now in direct <unk> to what the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as an entrepreneur , i was for the nobel <unk> around .
in the opportunity , because of me , i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
from now , can i imagine <unk> <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .
it 's trained , which , but also its ideals contains .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the totally like .
and if you can to see , then you think you really , the offspring , because we need to us to our future , not going to do .
yes , right after the school , he then there 's begun to work in our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is he also very good .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something is there 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not be more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so that the entrepreneurial says he then always .
companies are , in all <unk> .
and that they like him as well .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , he 's because the same detected .
so , not that he told him for you know , but that the <unk> says to the , what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , you cut , he was surprised when the him , then the <unk> personally was introduced .
as mister <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , he then there are introduced .
the janitor 's great pleasure over years , so with a young people together , and his his experience of science .
and the two , then by other , i found .
and have , more hit .
how about it because if we now , so in a lot of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how it was because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by business ?
that i still not so , understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yeah .
the established markets , established products , established customers , established structures , there 's a sophistication .
and you can also quite exactly the quest . ab : there , where the big , we think .
and let 's a ai <unk> , the very neat is it 's also .
what 's because then we actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> , so one is that 's put it does n't guarantee it is not the small copy of a company .
it 's something very different .
it , yes , a completely different character .
because it has , nothing <unk> .
no by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
from that 's a <unk> a temporary organization that the purpose is a business to go to find , to develop the impact of this is , of course , that , but in any rate is , then we scale it .
and you will be safe to understand that it , so <unk> organization , very different very different kind of thinking , there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yeah , it 's me , right .
but , what we look for because actually ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then it 's hear , because you can <unk> <unk> to make money or ?
so i , let 's also degrees , that 's very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin would you to me that would recommend ?
that means <unk> .
as you say , your businesses successful <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> have .
oh no .
but really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> money in precisely what 's because we keep your <unk> ?
so we start you just a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , i know you ?
and we look , the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a much worse , financial situation ago when your great .
the money is always the outcome of a successful company , and a good , it turned enterprise .
now , you money is an energy for an enterprise actions .
and it is the foundation all of economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , which is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , i guess what they do , i , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , really need to guess , and then and measurable in time when you are being and so forth .
and when i do it 's not , ' , so that as i can for something of , i do n't know what i 'm supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , because we decide , and risks , because it feels , for me , everything that i think , and inherently .
yes , <unk> welcome the enterprise .
but i , there might do for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so , almost a secret .
successful <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for sharp .
so , or how does tell you today ?
<unk> know , i , <unk> ?
so we say , always <unk> on this .
in for all the crises and <unk> and <unk> sustainable uncertainty .
so it helps guaranteed .
i think , i can you one of contexts .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask you put more .
that can you , the same time when you know one of the enterprise qualities is good question is to start .
we can see the time , after the other to go to the perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want this happen ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what it , you that about you move beyond that it as you yourself ?
what <unk> you on the world ?
what we have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to do ?
what are your inner , perhaps , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see it ?
because that are also your enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this kind of them ?
if you a ship and you want to then <unk> not the men together parts of a hot , wood to collect , but i teach them , yearning for the is , an ocean .
yes , well .
so then i look , i let me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now you can do your target that time i could color .
actually could color in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you in a few years ago , if you went <unk> , what you do n't want to then it will , you 're going .
you know , the story with the pink elephants ?
it , i think it 's degree .
not ?
<unk> .
so , along the time on .
'cause you , no pink elephants .
okay ?
it does it 's already ?
so no pink elephants .
understand ?
no pink elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we were so on it 's focus on this , what we do n't want .
what 's actually the only way ?
because it occurred <unk> ?
yes , now , you get out , you that , what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the pandas on the <unk> .
but you get out , you very sort of years ago .
the way , what i just thing you like , <unk> or ?
i , you , because one with them .
look over time , if you do <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this war <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to z <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my carroça <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady smith .
oh , but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> buy you <unk> ?

<unk> from <unk> .
it 's answered a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> buy you ?
and <unk> what 's from ?
you know what we noticed ?
which , something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , and then we can look , then we can look , where the bear with that is .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this war <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to z <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my carroça <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady smith .
and <unk> , as it 's hear you that ?
so , i know , i was also shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i have the first time ever seen , ' .
i thought it ca : yes , it was being .
and it , a lot more shocking , i was when i 'm going through the head into this is it might be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
by my life .
and admittedly , i mean , this is yes , meaning .
the end up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent us to the most of our perception and our <unk> undercover <unk> .
but what 's because now , to ?
what <unk> ' i was , and what <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and therefore <unk> , among you , your perception breeding somewhere <unk> pleased to this is a more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we get , the next question .
how could i really want to my goal come ?
so , i find that a good question .
that 's like , when i think that every time , and i know that somehow not going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's a good news for you .
that you get lighter fall when you may have known as you have .
because if you , your of what 's clear , your inner drive , and if you went 'n , in the goal is a lot of presented to have i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you 're going to do n't help you can than that a brainstorming , you 're going to make things , you kind of .
that are then these famous <unk> , you the morning under the shower , you 've done .
and still a question i 'm going to you , to look , you a good to , who you have them could who you to take an interesting questions could talk to go there are more input , more at some of your home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have that 's really marry .

to lunch at the famous of the table .
and that is totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , bankers , as engineers , architects and he has a very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our today , where it 's drum went , who is , through ?
who 's right ?
but rather to the kind of these different <unk> things about from the people are so , none of the way of where you 'll have to come to .
well , the next question is what 's next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of the big to and management and so what you , just in the next step .
because what to because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the lead this very determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then there was well , dan searching , you , <unk> one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's , a different .
so it 's important that you 're saying what 's clear .
that you the inside of security .
and the way , how we actually have all going to learn ?
although we do that yes , do n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- it 's there 's also <unk> in children .
so , this playful attempt to learn , this and cultivate this <unk> playful for it 's also , the fun doing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also what kind of the <unk> against the uncertainty , otherwise , so anxious power .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , yes , very good .
but i do n't know , with me in the company , i think , there must , many of bosses change that 's something happened .
and ourselves , so here in germany , there 's always been so these general mood .
and i think , there would have to the politicians to find out to worry that , to change .
okay , my boy , come from the time with .
how do here 's go down the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
ten ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look at here comes down .
if you see ?
alright , the .
this is the , you do you ca n't expect to do you really change can .
or to it with mahatma gandhi to say , looking at the change that you in the world , looking , you yourself .
do you feel safe beautiful words and big models , but how would do that , work ?
because we have , still 'n some <unk> on our <unk> .
i think , in all <unk> of crisis , or if you to be small , you feel for something or if you an almost interestingly , and they 've all with you to do .
and if you fall in such situations wondering what you see you now , despite the top of like , you , which is you take you can physically came to give you very powerful to feel .
it 's like , you , it if you to them like , the user , do you 're <unk> .
and , finally , to ask , you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because it .
so i mean , if , you already happening is that , and so , at least worth it has .
yes , well .
mister <unk> much .
and you think that you want to me that 's going on my enterprise away ?
yes , right .
and realize you do so , two things .
first time one on the clarity of your inner <unk> and then to your contributing to do what will .
because it determines your perception .
and to the second one on your inner attitude to myself .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behavior .
the future is always just then when we shift your perception .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
now , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold , because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
clear .
which i do so , the spirit , i see .
<unk> called breathe stressed .
and this is that , what the <unk> really is .
a <unk> from potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
now there 's the <unk> .
the result , nationally already been in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert bosch about <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , just that spirit to animate .
and who knows , maybe it , from our <unk> the next leonardo our time .
you see , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so to me to me with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because finally , are , yes , so to our future .
instead is that the view , i kind of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in jail .
four years ago , my father and i was the program <unk> , entrepreneurship for prisoners , i 've started .
we qualify <unk> captures that means you can , after the prison , either on making or find after their was lighter one workplace , they actually , can hold .
why would take care , i now , so it so the <unk> , so the ones who have failed are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not so easy to understand how programs that , the kids do .
and frankly , i had said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , in that i work would .
what you think that 's the most of a factor in childhood with the people with that we work ?
we 've learned , it are positive models of male positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it 's the father had no sensible work , that he -- that he drugs consumes or that it yourself in the auditorium .
and if you a seven-year-old boy , i think about what he from his life to make it 's maybe it does n't even better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was n't even better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> ' them , martin , imagine .

his father was involved and made the whole family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 , it 's his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother had the home .
and he was the <unk> the great .
he was shy , and <unk> and so the perfect victims .
to the day as being a little baby brother , in a game , so roughly <unk> had been is that the bottom of thing .
there was burned , martin , the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy off and proposed to .
and do that day he was respects .
and it went off .
and violence was part of now , his life that 's the his father .
how it 's now at the ones that i just described , that , on ?
after the childhood , the youth who are many unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than their illegal activities , and their <unk> <unk> .
and then they are no one day with people in jail closed organizations that 's like that goes to think about the same over the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , if you put together in prison sitting there ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level , and we 're still in the prison where they 're going to see the prison <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that go in germany will everyone on the second criminals back .
then there 's now , people in prison , the , really do want .
but also , these people who carry a rubber on the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first identity .
if you know , a work for , if you know , an apartment for whether they found a private build a relationship to all around them to be with that identity , with that rubber face , you a blessed in the society that infinite hard power .
this is the problem , in front of , we are .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
what they have this , you think , and many <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it are entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> which has seen definitely no idea of <unk> , from <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in prison landed .
these characteristics we want to a good use .

we get all of the kind of of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in order to write its own <unk> and everybody could take on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then just to the people were also , the prison in the <unk> , <unk> in the strengthening of your personal relations and also in one of <unk> .
what for a big , because of our program , and out ?
it 's a range , the <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .

<unk> leaders , talent and his illusion of the rapid money to have him , very early to trade with their leisure seduced .
he had always been fun of businesses to do .
he is then <unk> the first time arrested .
and this prison , it 's not very impressed me .
it in the opposite .
he says , i have today , he would have at its second custody prepared .
<unk> is he then to the second time ever been wrongfully convicted .
and he then only a wall of therapy part , and then the <unk> .
and he did , he used to become leaders talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , then october <unk> its agency for <unk> started .
the agency goes well , he can now of life .
it , very good <unk> prepared .
he 's now here with me .
who him to know to talk about it .
, back to martin that i told him to begin with about how did .
martin , after his childhood an education , chef leave and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and they go up there , the agenda are was being that is quite quickly started .
he worked with a dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , which he took this life .
and he says , that he was out with this lifestyle to do n't own self-confidence <unk> .
one day that he got someone in a <unk> so hard that he then convicted .
he took the <unk> part , and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , and it to more force to more success and more quality and i could come up without its kisses to make juice , or without drugs to consume .
and he was from his — so excited that he had decided that would he would pass .
and he wanted part of the <unk> .
that 's unclear ] .
he works for now , two years to us and <unk> our participants in their way into the freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you really change to , and if you have the right tools , at the hand , you get that much more is possible , when you 're oftentimes i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people that with us in jail , the way to the external events , with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal plans to get you .
that are our speaking , the <unk> talks , in our class , and keep track that are students at the <unk> do , <unk> the begin to make change .
and that are our mentors , our participants thing to the prison with .
and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events , an exercise that , <unk> calls .
we 're pasting then in the space as a big so our participants standing on the one and our an standing on the other side .
and i 'm going to be different questions .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , yes , you answer is he believes in the line .
and here shows , what we all have that , whether we within the prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the differences are , is this question .
i 'm in a so-called social focal point up , i had a family , what already once in custody .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line , and very few of our an environment .
a question , i 'd like to now , all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
and please , i want you that they all of even get up .
maybe we can be a little light to get in the audience .
i can you see .
there 's all .
well .
thank you .
i get out , you now a question , and if you that question , yes , answering put them , again , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's kind of our our line , we now .
i have in my life of things done , for that i was punished to get it was , but not .
if you that question , yes , answering put them , please .
that counts , drunk car risks .
that counts , maybe as low quantities marijuana obsessed .
that counts , the seat , not very , to have .
okay .
and it 's also to be any workforce , not always very correctly for .
you know .
most of the seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they must , all back down .
in this question , if that we went on the past so , get our an environment very often to me thinking .
and you will also clear , how much , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the time they were growing up , with the friends , but also very fortunate that you may not always been with caught by these are you do something that 's by the <unk> or also about it out .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni finding from within <unk> days after their was a workplace .
this is a very quickly .
<unk> percent have , already on the time .
a third of the donor in the last year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a <unk> , -- what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> , usually <unk> percent for a massive saving means .
when my father and i put together in the <unk> founded have , we 're quite frankly , the first group of pretty much for quite nuts , that i 'd been .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses up .
but i want to tell you , i picked up in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants that 's responsibility to take over .
the responsibility , what in your life 's happened , and so , responsibility to take that in their lives will happen .
now , not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also , again , trust and build .
and so it makes me , especially happy and pride and when our participants , of their way to tell us .
now , i did you a video with them .
the movie .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because of <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months convicted .
i do with marijuana traded .
so , i judgment of two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my whole life changed .
and what to me was important , was this <unk> that 's also made .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , to ' i almost to say , yeah .
i went back goals , and as the tip .
i 've got back in perspective of mine . i 've got back to jump forward on .
and you go with a very different awareness and consciousness of the prison out .
so far it 's more and <unk> without fixed goals and then is you , in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now , not anymore .
well , the problem is that many no assistance systems have to the emerge .
that the biggest problem , because then is a lot , that you go back in the old backward coming .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> delivered <unk> , whatever , what 's all are going , with me just all my thinking about me putting yourself , about other , over the kinds of problems , over the kinds of the society , that , with me just during these two weeks , if we really .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and since 14.7 six months bye '' i went back with her together .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because when i think one of , through this whole <unk> and many other things change , ' .
so much , ' i 've achieved .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , to ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you know that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , like for example , my mentor now , about this time , out and actually about being , i do n't know , <unk> engagement beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea of all got there are going to keep them so what do .
i 'm grateful for that they do it , with certainty trouble pulled , and i 'm extremely grateful for me to be part of all for .
that are one of course , the people , the support , and they were .
i like i said , with many people in the events which , and the me , confirmed have that 's good , that go back .
and the wind ' i am i also do .
and say , i thank you .
they come up with us in jail .
each of you have something that we need to .
if you know , our participants in their <unk> advised , as the <unk> to come from us whether it in the frame of financial support that are .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , very <unk> issue .
so it tells us , please .

and look for us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i got involved in <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i do something that way .
because you do , yes , these things .
now , for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's -- yeah , really are many ways as you with <unk> deal .
or how to <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n little with the <unk> .
which i think is really from <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me , what could be like my life in 10 or two , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability and i did frightening .
and it 's very least express .
, i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for the private .
i knew i just not going to the <unk> way to happen ?
do it to me just lazy ?
or what if i mean <unk> again to throw this ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that was so , the idea .
i was in this time to embrace <unk> in a day .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> was for me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you fluently , you look at the world 's living in very good hotels and fluently , the country in a <unk> of the way .
fluently , but to also very <unk> countries .
the developing countries where it certainly more to see , and tell you could think of thinking about quaint villages , that’s <unk> local people that , though they have nothing , so much greater happiness and joy broadcast .
what a lot of these images and cliché lives , but chronicles a way too .
and that was for me after a while the key .
i was that what i did to a little .
and so there .
and i found it 's a little <unk> from me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right to know .
the <unk> writing articles .
and to my personal interest to satisfy .
how you 're learning how we do know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
in the people who lives , you home .
not in the hotel .
by , with the challenges and with the problems of people .
and so as you with the people who works .
at least that was the answer that i went on this question to do .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy .
i wanted to contribute at .
something to do good .
and this sense , with me , in a <unk> further . it increases .
i was saying is that i 've already in developing countries , but nepal , i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war , not only countless orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems , and left .
with an annual income of <unk> euros nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to continue to the two decades , the poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from one of malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult male ca n't read and writing .
all these are connected with , you very personal stories and experiences , i went on this journey has had met me in a time , i was willing and open , it was to change .
in the time i even a change , i want .
and you stood for my return of nepal my decision .
i quit my job .
and she , the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt from the answer to return , i 'm going on my job application received .
because they just a defining .
it 's going to a serious application in <unk> international by a company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> that , at the time in nepal life , i want , and a funding , and the way .
hi ?
let 's still ?
i was really seriously , i mean , and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really flat-lined .
and , ' of course , a fairly emotional response written .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead , ' i do this , right at the feeling taken to what good <unk> to do .
i do it 's used as an engine , my own business to the reasons .
<unk> .
heart labeled and soul <unk> .
a company that , that offers , what i then for this .
because the way of a country to the way to do .
the way of a country right to meet .
and i do with the people , in life and you can work .
and that 's not anywhere can work , but in order to <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , though .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means that i 'm going to place in the way you 're good karma can gather .
in the you do good .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
it , but not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and tourism .
because the people that with us to afford , during and meaningful volunteering .
they pay for their journey , just like a different organizers .
but they travel , just a different .
you live in <unk> .
and the main is n't care as much recovery or as much <unk> , but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we need .
to engage myself , our participants and qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , gentle tourism , in the regions of the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism have happened .
because i just the inside the infrastructure that 's missing .
the other , we can sustainable projects forward .
we can reduce their sustainable projects -- and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also not on giving wheelchair-bound .

now we have with our work <unk> in nepal .
history convenes a year we have our engagement in uganda expanding .
and now , about four years , and , we now i got married and my husband and i are also for a team was a <unk> question .
we take the <unk> away on ?
or what if we still more of thinking ?
if we have the <unk> still going on this ?
if we do with this is not only social engagement and sustainable in my point of development in his wholeness that ?
and so , the individual <unk> integrate ?
or still detecting individual <unk> .
that would then , a new one extra companies .
a company , that , the company itself .
with other <unk> , but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
we want that ?
she was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure that we want that .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we 're in a ticking .
because we all the same language .
because we all the same dreams dreams .
because we all the challenges to understand .
and why we 've done in this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in its development and to <unk> that we 're going through the extraordinary people to support .
to be able to the participants who or employees of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> book `` the <unk> include .
and <unk> of the <unk> prepare .
the point it 's in <unk> , again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> , one another huge masses .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you think there is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown prejudice .
where you might want to a flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
it makes a its strengths of eyes .
it 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or whether it 's the serenity and that you create new in , discovered .
the serenity things we assume that you do n't we can change .
and the power , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
an example .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , lydia and <unk> .
that are five , and women from uganda .
with sads non-zero-sumness and with talent .
they will be a beautiful , deserved <unk> for years .
and for years was nothing .
because they simply no market for .
because they did n't know , the quality can improve .
because you , nobody has said , which design , maybe the answer comes .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
we have the people of poverty , get .
that you a income there .
a future to occur .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live , we 've gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of a thousand <unk> of our women .
the sales brings them not only for a year , income .
but it allows us , the project , much bigger .
this first edition , is sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in one .
so who are going to be this one thing , with the purchase a chain of doing to the other day , it , but with us , right into the project travel .
he can be able to the women travel , active <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women of giving , but its or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
this is , but this <unk> just a project from our integrated cycle of projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area , just to do when it 's .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , started .
everything we 're in our cycle of them together .
and the power to be more sense , as any one project for yourself .
in place where we 've ever , qualification into the different projects .
the kind of ways to a great , then , just in the common work .
and to school , and i want to you now , right on a journey to take them .
and to please , i 'm so the eyes to restore .
reset , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and you 're happy , and in there .
you 're dealing with your <unk> to had lunch .
there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in there is it 's warm .
you <unk> of the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet tumble the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin layer <unk> dust .
the children with laughter .
and out to having your name .
you <unk> you that they do you do n't even more than just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
but soon , you get up .
and the <unk> , on the men 's still the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going to lydia meeting .
in the meadow sitting in the shadow tree as you like the new designs their <unk> talk about .
like , you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come , the other women on this .

until you with your english to start .

in free-fall .
and that it 's still an internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
that <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again , and german , to talk .

and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots .
it 's a african song .
you 're sort of and happy .
you 're doing the eyes , again , do .
of us to be in the <unk> to meet , something new engage .
now , or for a short time that cube , i 'm going to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm starting to be an interest me , whether of you tonight is that they 're here , it 's find somebody 'n ' house occupied by .
i just know , with the light it does n't really well , but maybe you know , someone came up .
down here , i just ' i got someone .
two .
here to the top , i just ' i 'm not , but anyway , down here are already , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to <unk> .
i ' , a building occupied and that is the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
and on the other people , ' i think of the villa in the last summer , six months for that .
and so i stuck , i do tonight is here from them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
so what 's also ?
<unk> there 's `` yes , many .
but i think about it for just a .
oh , which , her occupied by now the villa ?
and her <unk> in the park or how ?
one small choosing the questions that we know , friends , who have asked when they 've learned that i became part of an initiative , i whistle , which , something <unk> names , <unk> am .
all those , that we will seamlessly in the front of the <unk> <unk> lanes .
and here 's going to these villa <unk> up , <unk> disseminating and so in suspended .
and to the privatization of villa to stop protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of the <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , you privately is , and so for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand is , and so it does n't be used to be about how to public spaces may use .

and we wanted to a different <unk> tell you .
we were a <unk> team and that i have to now , very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning socially -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , simultaneously , with different social cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and highly enriched .
and have us to , on different skills , but also in various networks <unk> .
and creative part of unconventional solutions in the <unk> , and then we did have , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa to occupy .
but it was about it 's about that we villa with stories and ideas that people .
we have to memories and that i 'm asking .
and out of these memories and images out to go to have faith , for the villa to develop .
this was it 's important to the process , a constructive remains .
let 's as an initiative , we 've been with things as <unk> platform , and as <unk> concepts .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional occupy and , and better to a <unk> .
on the experiences that we have , and they 've done , <unk> ' i tonight is to do .
every city has <unk> places .
that a neighborhood a face , there .
in many cases , this is a macro level , and commercialized and be in the result of citizens , as alien places .
they are the dead -- a city , because it 's often not the equal , what we 're in a public space and expect .
so for instance , that we <unk> have , <unk> .
to this , but also the fact , public , the urban places neglected , this is often did .
initiatives , the places like to want to stay often , <unk> interest already in the infancy stuck .
what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some out of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social locations of the city , in our social life is happening .
so how we lived there are often the first <unk> that they 're going to our neighbors , if we wanted to the way shopping to meet .
and you can take this increase , if we just an ai possibility that have to sit , and we actually stop , if the spaces , this , you 're doing .
and we just 'n longer shark .
it to form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to it 's a feeling of community .
ever more encounters , i have , and in this is a public space , ' more and faster and more , that 's also that community .
and when i 'm not <unk> , which is just that , what you probably the anonymous , a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for their neighborhood woken or in <unk> also <unk> .
how can protest , actually be transformed ?
how can criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and the equivalent of <unk> <unk> places and criticism against the growing and actually also not much <unk> of the same places .
imagine , you now , they sit here , again , they beat the newspaper , and read this text .
i love to empower and citizens , we invite you , we want you three possible varieties of the focus on the <unk> imagine that have a little bit about carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they must be in the following the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation with the most <unk> will then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event , go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it 's just a great .
there 's a way to select .
they must <unk> , like that in the future looks .
and again , it sounds , first time and the first moment .
i trial , let me , of an explanation .
and that is , because i was the opinion , they ca n't really has or an or shape , <unk> .
first , because the classic <unk> often , far too late <unk> .
that means mostly they do n't have a chance , really , your suggestions to make or some alternatives to discuss , but there 's actually been a design and they must <unk> still going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , like a friend recently , what color , the trash can have the example .
second explanation classic <unk> is rarely about information and vote out .
you think of the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and incomprehension are often the consequences of what i also a way , which is .
i have to be no choice about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i actually get a <unk> route , instead of <unk> <unk> had .
it goes , but also differently .
although it 's the overcoming the existing <unk> of conversation in fact , we have finally too much disturbed experience .
so , then we have experience up and the , i mean for other <unk> parts .
i think about it to convey in other initiatives , at the other projects , but also , or so , at the city and at the policy .
because of the ones who are , like <unk> actually able to say , and the really responsible for these processes are .
if there is really the interest of what is , how it so often to struggle and so let me is then we need and then we need to the people who did this new <unk> .
ca n't last <unk> ' i said , but also , they all that you today , sit here .
and that is so , because i <unk> for a really think .
i , ' it for most important that they all go , and i think about it with our example of encouraging , the <unk> still a chance to give them .
and i then i took me , they all , because they are the ones that in the who 's a new <unk> demand it can .
so , we have to what happens if you look like to the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for their neighborhood and they feel like to participation and <unk> to stir ?
first willingness to the conversation on the field .
in <unk> meet professionals in a reporter , citizens on <unk> and different interests together .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the way we invited .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all these conversations on the field of people , so that 's not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills about the missing in the citizens .
the citizens , there are experts , they are experts for their neighborhood , you know , what you are , which <unk> them with a place to connect , in which tradition , a place is , and also , what you , there 's missing .
the <unk> , in the city can bring , what on <unk> level in the project to do .
in alone or in in a particular case , and then another <unk> be involved in the subjects to make that 's on the project and are the after .
all this leads to a <unk> , in the rest of information for all that are and the then the place to be .
by may also you get to return , an identification , the place to communicate .
a dialogue going on the field also means that the capacity for the residents in fact taken seriously .
and that is also then , if somebody says , i want to a <unk> near the marketplace .
and that can say , in again , he got there , but the goal to be , in <unk> conversation with all of <unk> , which is the right solution , and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> accommodate , but perhaps , a different place .
well , it out of the dialogue , and then you come up .
second point out there are many different <unk> .
our <unk> is actually created .
one feels , totally as well , when he said , <unk> great group is , and you can talk .
take a can see is good writing to know , but the text and then not going on <unk> great group .
take a draws may be or photographing .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to be different <unk> give the different user to use .
we have here , for the way , just to come , there to be , first time to watch , what happens .
in the background is a small exhibition .
we have is the possibility of out , <unk> to give them .
we have the possibility of out , to paint .
we have the possibility of out , to write .
regardless of the age .
that was a <unk> girls .
we had the way of our ideas with their faces to connect to play ideas to <unk> .
and the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should have always been able to be .
it for example of a <unk> happen , it over <unk> <unk> happen .
the basis , and transparent having the results and the dialogue under the are .
we even have the process in parallel postulate on facebook with this , and on one of independent blog , and at the news <unk> about a newsletter distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often , too late on today .
in my <unk> event , there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but then when it 's very early takes place and the who best , even still do n't know , what do with <unk> area is going to .
if you through the dialogue , and so i 'm going back to the point , one , where there , discussed this is , which scenarios for a area in the question .
<unk> heard , to <unk> itself .
and that is , then , if not in the first , we just is that the <unk> event that , and so i look , but on the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if , citizens in your city will find and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous projects to see .
i ' here 's an example from <unk> , is the <unk> , is probably in many here .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are inside of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding , you should do now , or <unk> .
the time has to in august wrote the politics , he could not differently , as the idea to their own .
and the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i do n't even more to say , because he has to one of the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or administration .
the point , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .

the city was told <unk> is not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we 're looking for <unk> <unk> have to the rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city of the <unk> , the initiative that , there 's started , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere paint citizens in their own crossing the road .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> <unk> .
all seems so far , to now you would say .
then we doing but now , just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to them .
why ?
one thing , , because they said yes , a look for a 's all have or should have .
during the turning , it be the citizens initiatives , or businesses , in the rule on a for them in some form relevant part of focus has the city against the responsibility for projects that it 's by the attention .
and to another piece of course , the city of the projects are taking , are different tools available to .
a <unk> initiative , this only <unk> 30,000 .
also our goal was actually a temporary initiative that , your school , and i was about half a year of the results and the responsibility , the city , who wanted .

it run , when there .
so we have , now in the problem , that we are still not deliver could .
but we know , now , that when the city of the villa successful <unk> , if that there was actually are successful , and then a <unk> there will .
in what form of the place is , though , frankly .
and finally , now , i 'm convinced of that many projects that by their meaning , complexity or , cost of the city has evolved to have a chance of happiness consent , and identification , to create .
what if it on time , a conversation with the citizens <unk> .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that they do tonight is sitting here .
if we can make them on and at the fall because the <unk> of the citizens did n't even more than it as well , but as a meaningful .
this is it .
last night , the <unk> , we were here in <unk> in <unk> and they 're so the <unk> coming .
we have about <unk> spoke .
so this idea , a second chance to have , if it in this life did n't really , just , a second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively quickly to agree that 's two things that there , we do n't , and experience .
this is the puberty .
the second , there was also , by the table , the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , perhaps more humble out <unk> .
at me is it , now , are <unk> years ago , but the words lead to me , to <unk> hands .
my neck woman , together and i just want to go back on , `` retarded fool .
and then i do n't , how it on you was , but in my exams was then , `` the one that with the <unk> taken seriously , the was always beside me .
no idea , what kind of actually become .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me was completely clear , never again , school .
and so what i 'm going to say , when i 'm going on the year <unk> back of the most days , i went there is this , ' , i did , i 'm in schools spent .
with a desire and completely voluntarily .
how she was there 's that ?
like this happened ?
it started first time to make that something happens is , what i do n't do .
i got kids .
so , my wife 's got the children .
and therefore i was actually , very clear that you one is that , to these <unk> to take care .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there 's basically in this <unk> and whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that looked like that , how it back then , we looked like .
and that , and , as well , like how to school , and , and i <unk> , let me , human being here , yes , a failure .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard , and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i told me , oh , the sentence , ' i mean , then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from high school , from this high school , for a 's life really down to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 've actually in her <unk> , let 's really good need to ?
and you may have some things , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what is , in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time as much more knowledge in , <unk> , just , so i do it ended up on a whole again <unk> can be able to me that 's going ?
well , i ' that time i needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> from one point is about , if somebody 's a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good diagnostic properties has ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we look back , so roughly <unk> years , the middle of the <unk> century , like that god , you voted .
this is the time , in the time in germany , the <unk> then eventually fully was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we do it today , its roots .
and if we have the time , imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , they sort of forced by , the school to go and with knowledge of were that were then we really the only way , that had to get older , you know , and the facts and the information their time in contact to come .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket than the library , who was the time .
and the middle of the <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that go there , a big changes in the world and there were suddenly people who needs of these new machines have been able to .
simultaneously , but also human needs of these machines , wait , and repair it could .
and we need people that these machines to build it could and that these factories were .
maybe you see it already .
that <unk> system that we now in germany , you put it 's still have , has its root in this time .
and before a potentially make sense .
it 's , because it was probably really that was that , what i look at school because i learned , ' for a structure of the assembly line well , who the assembly line up , the stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
we let 's <unk> century , where it is , and we look at the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just about to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i thought , now is the time , now i do you 're on the first company .
yes , after some of them to me around and so with the internet , then <unk> ' i , then <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some companies are at us <unk> , and bigger and bigger and , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in the case <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we were then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so exciting jobs had been on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai n't have no idea that they have , what these people do , but when i want to the school and we had no idea that 's so what you ever would give them .
even when i <unk> did was kind of this is how the internet , you ca n't talk .
and the kids that we now the school , send the job to the in 10 , six , 20 or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know what kind of facts are the need to evaluate them in this future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so the future of doing this , who could tell me , because the <unk> for the saturday , there .
there 's <unk> golden ticket , i did , i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how to get , and then we 've got to school for a 's lives learning it ?
what are the things that we need to kids for a 's life to fit to do ?
and maybe it 's a view , in this , what companies today , they 're looking for .
that are , the <unk> from school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities , then in the company .
and if you , so a classic <unk> at right , then it says , first place , so what , like the expertise .
because i want . yes , so the reading , and so , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in abroad .
there 's going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and that you can basically , in three discrete groups .
this is , of course , and business too , and staff , the flexible , are , so flexibility is that one .
and then i wish , almost all their employees , they tend to think .
and then i wish , these companies , the <unk> .
so we have flexibility leaders , thinking and get bored .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly to understand .
if we look at the economy is actually works , how fast , yes , how fast , everything to change .
<unk> , at the whole business models are the internet , on the morning , their head .
and practice , i worked on , with this change can deal .
and practice , i worked on that are creative .
and practice , i , the <unk> .
this is quite the opposite of what the factory in the <unk> century of employees to the line of it had .
and the second subject of the entrepreneurial thinking is quite clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's the people that take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if this now , the company is , or as well as a wish we humans , take responsibility for that telescope .

and if we 're looking at the football world , remember , then there 's because the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina has <unk> <unk> portugal has <unk> and germany has a team .

that were able to the only thing to create .
and this , somebody , this big innovator our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the answers , the iphone invented , the has not the <unk> invented , has itunes did not , has nothing about being invented .
the had a team that 's made possible , because i just as a team in the that do what they 've done .
so a school , these three things that could , that if only , a school , in the time we 're looking for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing , and the is me almost more important .
and this is the learning itself .
if the one , what we think about the future with security to say it is that they do this is then it 's the ability , and new to learn and fun doing this to have this learning to the <unk> that we 're in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that if only , but a school , these things that .
but where i was ?
i was sitting in this <unk> and the kind of them , the kids have that you know that 's not just a kind of this is , for that you <unk> to pay .
so this ai event , after the slogan of all it said , not from each other .
to the time , where <unk> elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i sat there and what can i say , <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress around the subject homework and learn the whole family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the kid sick will , because at school in this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> at this school , again , so 'n <unk> .
and it was also not <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , so to the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents that were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also told me the details by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child 's your calculators , that 's not .
<unk> are , but the two years , in which we did have given that does anything .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question , which is our child , fail ?
and we are the only , where it 's about ?
now , ' i got into the last two years , since i put in the subject , i 'm involved with very many people who spoke and i did , and found , no way i ' learned , you 're not alone .
there are very many , where it very similar to go and that was two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just in fact , a new business to , have the day we thought , where the journey , there goes , and night , we sat on the bar and have to worry about the private things to be .
and what can i say , he told me almost the same story with one of his children 's almost as we 've experienced as we said , and that we had been fortunate to our children 's take you could take from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> at different schools and we could even schools in order to consider .
but you can that everyone out there are doing ?

and after we both right now the sense , school , since we were there 's not that really changed and we thought , yes , we are the first , the topic that now , do .
it , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is that we be fooled .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast as a whole range of amazing people found that is similar to how we , which is a school to create that everybody who are doing right .
it is yes , not that 's the children and their parents under the suffering , which goes out there are often happens .
if we were the teachers to look , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look , the number of <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the evidence , doubled .
it 's going to be that all parents , what you are doing ?
that all children dying are and that , those teachers broken are ?
or it , that we have a system that have that 's not just more like this fits , like this <unk> , <unk> years , does it also not more like this right .
and we have many people found that it gets that went and we 've even people found that are not have children .
and they 've understood that you take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , now to school . go to hang on the way , there .
and we have at that <unk> , it 's gotten there 's out a whole range of great initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost , every school teacher , really involved , are and a change .
and there 's even the , or another brave principal , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had , no concept that we are there is now about helping us could .
but we can make one do , we can in those schools , and we can in these schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with are in two days a lot of moving .
there are so people together , in the past , rather than that other , have worked and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
that come with <unk> , concrete challenge of them together to solve .
and after two of those days have the then , for a new <unk> developed or the gun given for a completely new high as we 're in berlin school , just be allowed to .
or that have no idea for , for <unk> problems that they do in your school that have evolved .
inside of two days after all evolved to find that the next day , which can be .
but what that i could is said , what these two days happens , and that makes it for me and so beautiful , the number of the weekends , i , then also , schools , germany to spend , is this energy , there is when the three things better .

so basically leaders , thinking and if you , as a team experience .
then is that a spark , etc. , .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , it ai n't manage to come back then you know , we 've seen that , the school as a whole has to change that there ai n't entirely new culture .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> ' , invite them over the school to think .
i <unk> ' , invite , over the school thinking .
and i <unk> ' they do so , also invite , about , over the school , to talk .
so you about this , what you like , but i talk , they do it , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much disturbed you get , and how many people that same have experienced , but just not talking about .
you make us , let us on every school in germany , the <unk> century , to get .
you make us the entire system to change .
and you make us this together to do with the people to the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because it together , we can do this .
thank you .
