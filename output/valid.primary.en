you know , one of the big <unk> the travel and one of your children at the <unk> research is , who share with the people to life that , the old days you can remember , the your past , still in the wind feel , you on the rain <unk> rocks touch , it in the bitter leaves the plants and taste .
it 's going to know , <unk> still beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest on the inuit -- still full of what are , that the himalayas and the buddhists still the breath of the <unk> tracking , which means , the central epiphany of anthropology , the memory capacity to shout out that 's the idea that the world , in the time we live , not in a total of exists , but just as a model of reality , and as a a bunch of certain ways , and by the way we know , <unk> succeed , in many generations of chose .
and of course , what we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to do with the <unk> separation through the death , obviously , and so to leave it 's not surprise that we all the singing , dance , and art , this .
but it 's interesting is the unique vocal cadence of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it , the <unk> in the forest of borneo -- is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is to the colleague , i 'm a month ago in the desert traveled am . '' or even a <unk> at the on the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that 's still have another <unk> , one of thinking , other ways to its house on the earth there .
and that 's an idea that , if you think about , a deal with just hope for it .
together to form of thousands of the world a net of <unk> and cultural living , that the earth <unk> and for the way of the earth as important is the biological <unk> , that you a biosphere .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can use that when the sum of thoughts and dreams , which is the ideas , inspirations and this intuition , the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , being were going to be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's a symbol of all to what we are and what we as an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere strong away , they did this with the <unk> -- only with , so far more speed .
not a biologist would consider for example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all species on the brink of extinction are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biodiversity -- is not the , which gives us as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity , is .
and the key indicator for that is a number of these languages .
as any of them in this room was born , were on the earth 6,000 languages spoken .
now is a language is not just the totality of the vocabulary or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human mind .
it 's a means , the soul of a culture access to the material world finds .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and of that 6,000 languages are today , as we 're here in monterey sit , that 's not more in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're infants do n't even more about teaching . that is , if nothing else has been going , they 're actually been dead .
what might be lonely , as the silent <unk> , one of the last yours is people to be that your language to talk , no opportunity to have the wisdom of the ancestors science , that kids to expect ?
and yet stamp this horrible destiny , somebody somewhere on earth , i think about . all the two weeks , because of two weeks , you kill a older , man , and take the last <unk> from an language , in the grave .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not better than that ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i 'm saying , '' well , let this language yoruba . let them <unk> .
let them kogi . ''
and then you were suddenly realize , how it , if you get their own language , it could talk .
so i want to you today , of on a trip across the <unk> take away , a quick trip across the <unk> to try to you get to do , which actually been lost .
now there 's some of us , the way that i went to deliver , when i say `` different ways of being , '' really different ways of being mean .
take them for instance , this child at the <unk> in the northwest , the amazon , the nation of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east , from the belly of sacred queues <unk> .
this is a people , which is not cognitively between the colors , blue , and green is different , there 's <unk> the forest , of people on , <unk> .
they have a dip to the language , and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to marry someone , that one another language talks .
so all this is rooted in the mythological past . that appear to be at this big houses , in which one of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , is , is that you never hear somebody said , that one learns language .
they just hear , and start , then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , which i ever lived have to the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first , in 1958 peaceful contacted .

they threw a little photos of , from the air down , what we as a friendly gesture them were . and saturated with you that these people from the rainforest in your life , never be something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> were not only be with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations back and found two cases of natural death and when we had the people with forcibly something about <unk> , they 're going to that one of the people that old , so it was that he 's because of his age , and we were able to him , with the spear .
but at once they had a clear have the forest , the amazing .
their hunters who were able to the urine of the animal from 40 percent of the smell and determine , which species , this was on .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard , he said , if i have to be interested , i was to go and the secret societies to infiltrate the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> were and the venom , that this was used to <unk> to try to make sure .
and this wide a sense to give you had , i want something about this really believe in the <unk> knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the point , it 's going to start to a complex forget about the world .
it 's interesting .
if i asked them to ask , the great world , or , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or what 's also always .
a continent will always leave out , because that he was that it in sub-saharan africa is no religious faith in one of course there 's a and <unk> is just the <unk> this very prize-winning religious thought that during the tragic diaspora , the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirit .
the spirit can go from underneath the big water evoking , the answers on the rhythm of the dance , the soul of living with whom out to , so that the <unk> for a shiny moment , god will .
cram say the <unk> like , `` your white goes in the church , and you talk about god .
we dancing in the temples , and be able to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed , me , you going to the mind that . how can you damage added to be ?
you see these amazing demos : <unk> in one had been , the red coal without the burning <unk> , an amazing graph of the ability of mind at the body is supposed to influence that 's <unk> , if he was in a state of the extreme arousal , who will .
now , of all people that i met , to have , what was the kogi from the sierra nevada de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most .
all around the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> plain from colombia , the world and in a result of conquest , moved , that people in a <unk> huge massively , that over the <unk> plain there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only that never of the <unk> conquered .
to this day , they kind of ritual priesthood governed , the training to priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> to the age of three and four years of their families separately and in a <unk> world , the dark , in <unk> at a fab the glaciers for 18 years by that . two periods of at nine years , deliberately elected , the nine months of pregnancy , suddenly , you in which of her mother to contribute to spend it now <unk> in which resulted in the big mother .
and during this whole time , they are culturally in the scores of society which effectively . values that the claim sustain that their prayer , and only their prayer , the cosmic -- or we can say the ecological -- notice that sustain .
the end of amazing <unk> they are no one day , suddenly , out and the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , if the sun 's starting on the <unk> the amazing beautiful landscape to radiation , suddenly everything , what they in abstract have learned in scale of grandeur confirms . and the priest kick back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , i 'll tell you have .
it 's wonderful . you have it to protect . ''
they call , the older brother and say that we have that we have the younger brother are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we 're going to colonization , and the landscape , thinking , yes , we 're either <unk> and the old who the fancy wild up , which in his simplification of a <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature connected , when we did .
so , and then aboriginal communities are n't sentimental , you going to the nostalgia otherwise .
it 's not a place for the <unk> swamps , from <unk> or the cold beat , from tibet , you have , but anyway , through time and my ritual a mysterious <unk> below the shaped , not on the idea is based , you 're close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , just existing can , because it in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little girl from the andes , in the one up the mountain in a <unk> is , his or her destiny determine , well , another person , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place to have , as a little girl from montana , in the one up to a mountain under a bunch of stone is , in their can be .
if he had a location of mind , or a bunch of <unk> is , of irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the forest of british colombia , and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> .
it made me to a different people as my friends under the <unk> , believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> minds are the <unk> the world where the spirits , they 're looking at their <unk> coercion can be .
now , if you start by the idea to look at that these cultures , various realities are able to , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand , like . this plant here .
it 's a picture that i just last april in the northwest , the amazon into .
this is <unk> , of the whole lot of you 've heard , the most powerful sorts particular kind of repertoire of the shaman .
what <unk> so fascinating , is not only that <unk> potential of this <unk> , but of processing . it will actually from two different sources made . on the one side , there 's this wooden <unk> , the number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , some hallucinogenic , to . these <unk> by taking that 's about as if , a blue <unk> smoke on their minds put , it 's , but with the leaves of <unk> from the family , the <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> the serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you 've even the <unk> have seen , this stuff twisted , this substance of them from different ways to make it also <unk> .
this <unk> to twisted that 's about how from a <unk> throw , <unk> of baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .

but the thing with <unk> is the that they do n't <unk> that , you can be given that you through a in the human gut , naturally <unk> enzyme with names <unk> , <unk> .
they can only in the connection with some other chemicals <unk> that , you 're going to the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> contain are , <unk> of exactly the way that are , which is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask , so itself .
so how these people from a <unk> by 80,000 species <unk> plants , these two , morphologically not related plants to find that , if this way , combined , sort of <unk> version of creating so that the larger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism to try and error , which , rendered turns out .
but we ask you the indians , they say , `` the plant talks to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 varieties of <unk> that they all in a distance in the forest recognize that for our eyes of as well be .
and then ask you , their taxonomy of see it , and they say , i thought , you do something of plants .
i mean , you know anything at all ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out , that you have any of 17 varieties , <unk> absolute and they sing to move in a different <unk> .
now , that does n't give them ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that even those of us , the concerns for the hard to the native americans have , as <unk> and colorful , look , but somehow on the past of , during the world , which our world , progresses .
so , the fact that is that you that in the 20th century . it , 300 years , not for his war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , in the time we <unk> were and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on the earth , either actively supported or passively accept . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have again , at the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux , when you a bow , and the arrow tasks , as the americans stopping americans , when they horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change , and technology threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the rule .
and where we also always play , in the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the height of the <unk> . that are dynamically and uncontacted peoples , whose existence by visible very much , that is the over their capacity , and beyond . it , and the <unk> deforestation in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , from <unk> , a people , that , one generation freely in the forest , living , and you to <unk> and prostitution , the river of , from where you can see that even the river with the mud polluted will , almost half of borneo in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . from where the japanese <unk> at it to see that are that are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill that they do the forest away . '' or as in the case of <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we 're in the mountains of tibet and go , where i <unk> much on , you that ugly face the political dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's kind of , but the <unk> , the destruction lifestyle and the people , will not only convicted , but generally , and <unk> as part of <unk> celebrated .
and they do that suffering <unk> does n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level , you have seen .
and i went even with a young , or 6,000 miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> after <unk> and only when i want to <unk> came , i saw the face of the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , in the rubble , and ash into each . 1.2 million people that during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed each .

this meant that he during the chinese invasion immediately killed .
his uncle bug with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people to nepal brought them .
his mother was locked up , as punishment for -- for the crime wealthy .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled to , under your <unk> to hide , because they do without it 's not alive .
the twin sister , these <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> to the country .
one day in them out on them on a armband around and for those <unk> had to them for seven years in a heavy camp .
the suffering <unk> can become intolerable , but what the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end up , that we really , a choice . we want in a <unk> world , the <unk> or in a <unk> world , the diversity of life ?
margaret mead , now , the anthropologist said before they died , it to make their greatest fear is that while we 're in towards a thread , <unk> , generic at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination on a <unk> mindset reduced would see , but that we have one day from a dream up , and i 've forgotten , that 's one of any other possibilities that there .
and it 's humbling it to think that our species , maybe we have been over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , the agricultural brought , and us this moment in the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry , the shaman through the purple prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and surplus created -- and an hour ago , only about 10,000 years .
the modern industrial world as we know it 's hardly 300 years old .
well , these <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , that we 're in the next millennia to stand .
if we are those thousands and <unk> after the importance of human questions , the answer them with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we become the opportunity to rediscover that , what we are : people with demonstrates consciousness , the fact , the importance are aware that all people and gardens , a space , are being able to <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture that i was in the northern tip of the end <unk> into , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , i told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the inuit handle , and during the <unk> years of the establishment of our out , they forced me , in settlements , to move .
the grandfather , this old man refused .
the family , the fear to be life was , i took him drink of guns and all the tools .
now to you know that the inuit -- not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> were originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped up , they made .
the grandfather of the man was afraid , not going on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> , out , made his pants from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the rotating to market started , shaped , he goes , the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva on the sides of the <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog that .
he <unk> the dog and improvisational a <unk> , i took this skeleton of the dog and improvisational a <unk> , secret is a different dog , and <unk> over the <unk> with the <unk> the belt .
so you come from nothing to do something .
and this is on many ways of a symbol of the resistance , the inuit -- and all indigenous on the world .
the canadian government had the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control over a field , that it , california , texas .
it 's our new homeland , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a completely independent area . they control all <unk> .
now , which is an example , as a nation , the state , atoning with its people , and can achieve .
and eventually , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant for the earth , across are , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> from someone else .
they represent parts of human imagination , in times past the way back . and for all of us to be the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we 've done in a national geographic , trying to do is that we think that we have never going to achieve .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not persuasive is , but we believe that storytelling change the world , and so we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million ones every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
our magazines will , read .
and we are a series of travel in the <unk> , we are our audience to places of such as cultural wonder , take that it 's a couple of you just by spreading . and hopefully , they become a after the other , the central epiphany of anthropology on one : that this world , it deserves , in various ways to exist , that we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find them , the wisdom of all people to our shared well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what i do you first , so as quickly , you 'll show , is the work , a new technology that we microsoft , as part of <unk> ago exactly one year , who have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in the time you either local or away with huge amounts of visual data can deal .
we see many , gigabytes of digital photographs here , you will seamlessly and continually <unk> , pan , in any way to make arrangements .
and it 's no matter , how many of information , we look at the size of these collections are or how big the images .
the most of you 're using digital photographs of a camera , but this is , for a cat scan of congress and it 's in one area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the one , what the performance of like this is cut it , is the number of a pixel on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , a sample of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . any tearing is a chapter .
to prove that is really want to a text and not to a picture is , we can produce something like that do anything to really , showing that that 's an actual representation of the <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of <unk> .
and that you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , which is , sort of medium with several scales .
we 've also something at the corner of this special edition of the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high , which are designed , much higher than with a normal earlier this is , and we 've added content added .
if you the features of cars look like , they can see here .
or another models , or even technical <unk> .
and that she really these ideas on , these constraints , there are a place on the screen arguments .
we hope that no pop-ups and other nonsense , which means -- that should n't be necessary .
and it 's the mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i think about this really not much to spend time , except to say that we also to this area that are .
but that are all the roads in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
you make us to try something else out .
this is actually now live in the internet . it can <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research <unk> waves , noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> from microsoft , i 've done before . a very good working together .
so that 's live in the internet . it 's going from <unk> powered .
you can see that , if we are these kinds of views , in which we by images through , and this experience the <unk> , which do .
but the spatial distribution of the is here , of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together lasted so you the real space , of on this footage that the near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies were made , equal . you see here elements of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship with each posed .
i do n't know , if i still time , to have you very different environments , showing .
there 's what kind of a lot of spatial .
i 'd like straight one of the original pieces of noah show and this is by an early prototype of <unk> at the way we first time in summer , ever have to that you try to what i believe that 's really the punch behind this technology , the <unk> . and this is not so obviously , if you see the environments at that we 're going on the site .
we had the lawyers , etc . i 'm going to do .
this is a <unk> the cathedral notre dame lady , the only in the computer with images from flickr after . give you just notre dame lady in flickr , and they 're taking pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> , etc . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're seeing that all <unk> , and they all stand in this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can be in this very simple way to navigate .
it . you know , i 've never did that i ended up with microsoft work .
i 'm very grateful for the inmates had this .
it . i suspect , you can see that 's part of different kinds of these are , everything is that , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment patched me .
and if it possible , i 'm a couple of you find .
many of you 're from their faces , with , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame lady , the right recorded .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment and change .
the point is this is that we do things with the social environment , and then it can . it 's going to data from all gathered -- from the entire collective memory of the way , visually , the world looks -- and everything is going to each other .
all these photographs are connected to and it is something that it as the sum of the parts .
they get a model that from around the earth is .
so you see this as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that by the complexity , the people using it , growing and to use for the user , with the application , is a greater .
their own photos are with metadata <unk> , the one another person on .
if , somebody on the trouble has done and all this kind of them , and becomes , who you 're all and it 's my photo of the notre dame <unk> suddenly with all this data , held and i can you when i started using , in this space to come , in these <unk> , the photos of the other people use and so a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of other players doing .
and of course , as all of the people are immense , the virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , not just by <unk> or satellite and so on the were , but through collective memory .
thank you .
it . i do you right ? their software to to a certain point , within the next few years , all images , somebody in the world together to be used in principle to be related to be ?
yes . it does not different than to discover .
you want me , made them to hyperlinks between the images .
and they do this based on the content in the images .
and that 's really exciting , you look at the wealth of the semantic information to think of a lot of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they got your and the text , the site contains a lot of information about , which is that is .
but what about it , if this picture of them with all their pictures of the reason ?
and then it 's the scope of the semantic <unk> and the wealth , the , it basically , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , it 's really incredible , congratulations .
you have much .
i 'm going to them some things from my book about the , i hope , in unison with other things are that they have heard . and i 'm trying to myself a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't have noticed .
i want to the start , what i call `` the official dogma '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> from all the western industrialized world societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal of this to maximize the common our own citizens is , about this , through the <unk> the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom , in , is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people freedom to have , act of us for , the things to do that our public good to maximize and nobody has to us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize .
ever more choices , people have , more and more freedom to have you . and ever more and they have , more and more common good , they have .
this is , i think , so deeply in our water ones that 's not in the sense to get it to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives runs .
i 'm going to them some examples of that there , which gives us modern progress in the technologies .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i want to just about <unk> say .
there 's 175 <unk> in my supermarkets , if you the 10 different extra <unk> not <unk> and 12 <unk> that they buy it might be able to a large number of their own lettuce <unk> making , in the very , no idea that the 175 in the shop for it 's the right .
so that 's what the supermarket .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business plan to a stereo at an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , are . and in this one of electronics business , there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of different <unk> facilities put out of the components that in a business are offered .
they must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i 'm a boy who was given that you could every phone hosts have to you wanted , as he ended , ma bell came .
they have your phone <unk> . they have it 's not <unk>
a consequence of it was that the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite nowadays , phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this is the mobile phones , the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch .
and they should be that , still not in your business and i 've seen , you can be sure that it 's going to be .
and what it does it brings people to the business to go and this question is to start .
you know now what the answer that question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a cellphone , to buy that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life , the very much more important than that to buy one of objects we 're going to hit the same explosion of choice .
health -- it 's not known for the case in the united states that , you go and the doctor says , you 're going to do .
instead they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says , you , if we created a to make or we could be doing .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , so what i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you , i would be , you know , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient autonomy . '' in this sounds like a good thing , but in the reality is a shift the burden of the responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone to know -- namely , the doctor -- to someone in order to do n't know , and more tomorrow 's ill and why not in the best constitution , is a choice to -- namely , the patient .
there 's such a marketing for <unk> medicine for people like , and me , that , if you think about , does n't make sense , because we 're not buy .
why do n't advertise them to us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is : they sort of us the doctor in the next morning to call and to a change the prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide to demonstrate .
we 'd not an identity , we can make them .
and we can make us so many new , how we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide , which for one of person you could be really want .
in terms of marriage and family , there 's a time , in the <unk> was that almost every one had and that you so fast married soon as you could , and so fast kids get as you could .
the only real election was `` who , '' not any day , and not what they do , we did .
nowadays everything is just have them .
i 'm teaching wonderful intelligent students , and i give them , 20 percent less work as i used to be doing .
and that 's not because they 're less smart are , and not because they have less carefully .
it 's because they do with other things too are , you ask , it , `` i have to marry or not ? should i 'm going to marry ?
so i later marry ? should i just have kids , or just have never do ? ''
that are all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to answer those questions , regardless of that if that 's all mean , in to do that i want them assigning meaning and a bad grade in my class to get one .
and actually , you should do this . that are important to <unk> questions .
the work -- we are blessed , as carl of wind , with the technology that enables us to every minute by each day of any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's actually a corner , of the i did n't tell me , in the <unk> works .
i 'm going to it does n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of choices to meet , and again , and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can our children with the football games could n't look , and we have our mobile phone in a hip , and our blackberry , among other hip , and our laptop probably going on our lap .
and if you all off , are , every minute , we have our child , <unk> of a soccer never we 're also , `` i should this call would ?
i should be in this email answers ? should i got this letter writing ? ''
and if the answer to the question , `` no , '' is it certainly your experience of the <unk> their children 's cloaking very different than it would have been .
so where we look , great things and a little things that material stuff and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world , we were actually saw this .
so i want to say , there 's some of choices , but not it was a question of choice .
and the world , we now live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes . ''
we all know what good at this is , so i 'm about what 's got this is .
all these choices we have two effects , two negative effects on the people .
a effect , <unk> way , is that he 's this , instead to be free .
with so many options , from the you pick it , it is people very hard , in order to decide .
i 'm going to you a another <unk> for example , to give a study about investing in volunteers <unk> .
a colleague of me , i had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> from about a million employees and i think about . in 2000 , very different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> of the employer offered , i took the part of the two percent .
they 're offering 50 <unk> at -- 10 percent less employees are taking part of as if you just five to be . why ?
because it 's 50 <unk> are the selection are , it 's hard to decide what you choose to that it 's going on the morning off .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know that 's not just means that people <unk> to eat when they come in retirement go , because they 're not enough money to undertake have , it also means that you 'll make this hard is that it 's great <unk> your employers miss .
by the not a part of giving them to around the u.s. dollars per year on the future employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it makes for the world that looks .
they like the decision really make , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund vote , or even the <unk> .
so this is the an effect . the other effect is that even if we have the lesion over , and make a decision , and that we have less happy with the result of the selection , as , if we have the way i 'd like us between less opportunities to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is upon by the large variety of different <unk> , if you kind of buy , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> is a perfectly ? it 's easy , imagine that it 's a different decision like you can make the better would have been . and what happens is this sort of an alternative leads to you the decision to regret , and this regrets of it 's working on the average happiness , you some of their impacts decision , as well , if it 's a decision was .
ever more opportunities there 's , more easy is it does nothing to regret that 's getting there for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan gilbert has a big at the morning is made by and he told as a very , the way , we evaluate things , and depending on to what we do it 's .
well , if it 's a lot of alternative to think there , it 's easy , attractive properties of one of alternative that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives , they 're elected .
here 's an example . for the kind of them , no new yorker are going to apologize to me .
but here is , what they have thought should .
here 's a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` ' '' and the man who thinks , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood that 's gone .
i could directly , my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the thought of that he 's the way you remember , the day , one day , a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce the average happiness that we 're going through our choice and get , as well , if that what we think you 've been fantastic .
and ever more ways it on the choice , there , more and more attractive properties of choice to the <unk> into account .
here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about the right now to live and maybe about things , to do .
but a very important point , he does is : always who do for one thing to decide , you decide , other things not to do .
and these other things like a lot of an attractive properties have , and it is , what they do n't be less appealing to do .
three : <unk> the expectation .
this , i met , when i took my jeans they wanted .
i 'm dressed me , almost all the time .
and there 's a time in the way that 's just me to a way that there , and they have bought it , and they have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you 're very long enough , by and often enough clean , you have begun , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to new me to buy , many years of <unk> , the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to risk , some <unk> or of the place ?
you want to buttons or <unk> ? rock or acid bathed ?
you want to me with holes ?
you want to the bottom , cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the way that used to the only way . ''
he had no idea that was , so i spent an hour with all these fuckin ' jeans <unk> , and spread the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put me , i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices made it 's me , it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it to myself to understand .
the reason for that i got worse , i felt was , with all this available for one , my expectations of that , which for a few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i was n't let 's expectations , as it only in a way that there .
when you in 100 percent of the way up , and it , one of you have all going to be so ,
and what i got was very well , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared to what i have had to what i expected , and what i do was getting there , compared to what i expected .
this add some of opportunities in the life for the people , increase power is the expectations of the people have about how good at the opportunities to be .
and this gets to less satisfaction with the results , the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows that . because , if it would say , you know what they all not what it 's the humans .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything bad was , than anything bad was , it was for the people can see these things to do that a surprise that were .
now , in the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , one thing that citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for that you ever hope it 's the things that are good as it a couple of you expect .
they 'll never have been surprised . because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to -- -- that 's what they all come out there are -- the secret to -- are low expectations .
i want to say -- for a little <unk> moment -- that i do with a woman married , i am , and it 's really wonderful .
i 'd let 's not much we can do . i did n't culturing .
but preferred is not always like a bad thing .
eventually , a consequence of the <unk> a bad at recognizing jeans , if it only one way to buy there is that if you 're thinking there are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of me are available , and they buy one of getting there is , and they 're wondering why , who 's in ?
it 's also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they have it better , can do .
with a hundred different kinds of me to the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , if you the results decisions are good , you feel , very disappointed about , they 're blaming themselves .
clinical depression , it in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a whopping -- not the only , but a whopping <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , this is that people who 've learned that there are because their standards , so high . and then , if you , these experiences itself to explain to , you think it would be your fault .
and that 's <unk> that it 's generally better go , objective , and we got the feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma , that one that we all for right to completely false . it 's not true .
there 's no question that is a choice is better than not , but it is not , that more selection is better than a choice .
there 's a magic of . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we 're going to that long as you have to the variety of our public good way .
now , as a policy question -- i am almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking . that what 's all these choices to the world societies , is the material wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we have of many of you heard about to the problem is not the way to a large selection is .
your problem is that you to a little bit .
so the things , i 'm talking about are a odd problem of the modern , rich , western societies .
and what 's so frustrating and upsetting is : steve levitt , you yesterday about talks about how this is more and hard to <unk> <unk> does n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not just that they do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
they 're going into that we got standing there .
if something of what the people in our society to this decisions , to come to the societies in which people to a selection , what would , would not only that live in the people improved , but our would also be improved .
and economists call this one <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry that it 's better about -- not only on the poor -- because all these large variety of us <unk> .
finally , read them please do this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it 's not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted view of the world -- and that 's about the way i do it 's going to read this .
ever more , but i thought about , more and more i came to the view , that the fish , that you know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> bonds , so that it 's possible , you have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> bonds , so that it 's possible , down , the average happiness .
you increase the lesion and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with one of security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> being from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for children , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of projects that we 've talked to talk about the human genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
in fact , we turn on from a new point , we have the biology digitized and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by the new life make and build .
we 've always trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and this in a different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it , the minimum components to them .
we have nearly 20 years now , when we do that <unk> have sequenced it was really , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world , the computer .
now we 're trying to be asking whether we live , you what can or whether we need new life make it can , because of digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species has the time , in the lab replicate it . and we 've tried to see if we do it with a still smaller genome , you can achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to give up from the 500 or so , here .
but if we were those metabolic map at that are very simple is , in comparison to our . you can trust me , that 's too . but if we all those genes , watch that we have one after the other eliminate can it 's very unlikely that way to a living cell lead to fall .
so we 've determined that 's the only way to jump forward is that chromosome , to synthesize , which allows us the individual components to <unk> and so some of the fundamental question is to start .
and so we started to the question , we can be a chromosome synthesize ?
what it 's the chemistry of these really big nano-molecular molecules to build this is still never been done before ?
and , if we assume that , we can do that chromosome start ?
a chromosome is that way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our steps in the digitization of life were exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , very slowly developed , but still increased . and our final point was now , of an exponential curve that .
we 've got 15 years ago , so i started .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review before we have the first experiments , and did .
like , turned out there 's <unk> extremely difficult .
there 's tens of machines around the world 's the little pieces of dna that can , 30 to 50 letters long , but it 's a <unk> process , so i 've ever known for you a piece of power , you cut more error is happening .
so we had a new way to develop with the way we got these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it 's a virus that the bacteria , kill .
we were little pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the compelling phase came when we do this piece of <unk> chemical and in a bacterium , and that bacteria are in the genetic code to read and made viral particles .
the viral particles that were then the cells that would and they came back and killing e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoken and they said that they get this model is to figure out .
they were laughing more than her , it 's doing .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted , a lot to go . we want a whole <unk> chromosome building . it has more than <unk> letters genetic code . so we thought , we build it in it on the size of the virus , what we need the size it on <unk> were able to understand what the individual components of living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in a computer will just want to this digital information that way to be .
when we had the genome for the first 1995 , have sequenced was the <unk> in a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we have the original sequence used to have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of the art is it , and to the 50 letters for these are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap to be able to get smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique elements of this into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into .
you think about it for : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids ; and there 's a single , what matters for each of amino acids .
so we can see the genetic code using about our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
and then we 've only signed .
some people were being that 's no poetry .
we have the pieces that 's that we 're just with enzymes , though they could . there 's enzymes , that these repair and stitch back .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters in terms , added these people to <unk> to try to this back into , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus is able to sequence them were , because we tried to a very robust process to create what they were in a minute to see .
we 've tried to point of <unk> to get there .
so , this is sort of like a <unk> .
if we 're going to these really big one person 's -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then we 're going to this is not just in e. coli grow . it adds up all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so i went to the other mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism for the <unk> recombinations is called , the biology is used to disrupt dna fix that these pieces together .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism called <unk> <unk> the three million wheel , radiation , fine .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome simply apart drops .
12 , 24 hours later , , it all over again that brought together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms that we can totally <unk> , you can even in a vacuum life .
i 'm absolutely not sure that live in space exist , can move , on the quest for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's a lot of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by that we have these are used to have -- actually , we 've just <unk> used to the right design the pieces , we have them <unk> . yeast and so this , then automatically together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's a big molecule that we actually made it with the <unk> can see .
that are footage of a duration of six seconds .

that are about <unk> letters , hiding code . it 's the largest molecule with <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we have a <unk> of 10 and without proportionately print one would it would <unk> pages from just to this genetic code <unk> .
now , how we turn on a chromosome ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very simple . it is more with bacteria to deal .
it 's also be easier if you know it in <unk> as we 're doing , you just take the nucleus out and there is a different inside , and this is that 's exactly what they all over the advantage of about .
in <unk> is that chromosome in the cell integrated , but recently , we have shown that you have a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another that can make and these are .
we have cleaned the chromosome into a <unk> . it 's roughly , are these two as far from one of how people and mice . we gave some <unk> to us to this pair chromosome choose to embrace . we <unk> and enzymes to all the proteins to destroy . and it was very amazing when we did it in a cell , gave me -- and they 're going to our very <unk> graphics here to value --
this new chromosome went in the cell .
in fact , we thought that 's the end is , but we 've tried to the process that 's going to earth .
this is the <unk> of here .
we find all kinds of species here , a second chromosome taken , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of the characteristics , just a second to a species <unk> .
people , so that , evolution can imagine , as a gene that 's going to a moment you can change it will have a lot of the biology missed .
there 's enzymes are the <unk> to be called the fact , dna digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes , we put them have already .

it <unk> , blue , because of the genes that we put them .
and after a very short time , it was all the characteristics of species lost , and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software that we 're in the cell , given .
all the proteins and changed , the membranes service , -- when we had the genetic code to read , it was that 's exactly what we joined .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by that we went <unk> shift , things quite dramatic change .
so i 've argues that it 's not the <unk> is -- that 's based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argues that we possibly do that are a new form of the cambrian explosion to create , it 's massive new <unk> based on this digital design that there might .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms of what we need .
we 're from the six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
and it in my connection to ask : i was , in 1946 born .
today are three people on this planet for each of , in 1946 , it has ; within from 40 years to do it 's four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , the fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion for every oil . that are a hundred million every now the day .
if we think about the biological processes to think , or any process to bring that replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's the co2 from this material that in the end up .
we 've now , from our discoveries of the world , a database , about 20 million genes , and i want to believe in it that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see , the diversity of the way , it was .
we hit here in the first line of the boundaries of the biological reality , and those , what we can .
we have today technologies that kind of rapid <unk> , to bring that do what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day can create .
if you imagine those 20 million of genes are making , or those processes to optimize the octane making , or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just a small team more molecular change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can , <unk> <unk> , one of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a tape of that 's really <unk> , we 're working with the play , actually sit down and new species on the computer designing <unk>
you know , we could n't necessarily as it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
what we are now on fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently corn and ethanol seeing what 's just a bad experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon as if you will be the much higher <unk> will have to octane or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact without another spike in the cost on food or the disappointment of the availability will have is , if we co2 as a material to see , and therefore we 're working on the cells that to go ,
and we think that we have the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 are a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we 've all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 described .
he lives in the deep , <unk> miles deep , in virtually <unk> <unk> .
it 's co2 in methane , under the use of hydrogen than the energy .

within a short four-year time , we think , we could be in the ability to be a lot of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> goals , like the patient 's the petrochemical industry . exactly what if you that 's not at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy use .
but as we 're working at this , the same approaches to the vaccines to speak .
they have it this year with the flu in that we 're always a year of the back up and have a way to a little bit , if the right lasts goes .
i think that it can be affected by showing you <unk> vaccines in advance .
this is it , like the future , possibly could look up with changes , can now the <unk> up to be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we 're light years of the people to improve . our goal is it 's only that we have a chance long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i put an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come to evaluate them to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so here . and for all those , the time was n't there were , the lhc is the biggest science experiment , which you ever approached by -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create , which is less than a <unk> second , and at the universe <unk> -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just breathtaking , very poor .
this is the machine below , geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in detectors on .
at that i work . he calls , atlas detector -- 44 feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction , so you the scale .
the 10 . in september the last year was the machine , the first time .
and this picture was one of an atlas .
it was huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the way across the lhc <unk> , deliberately with a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain from particles in the detector <unk> .
in other words , when we had this picture of 10 . in september saw , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , this , when someone in the google side to and the front page that i found was .
it means that we have a cultural influence the scientific trade .
about a week later , there 's a problem with the machine , which with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires here .
those wires in <unk> <unk> when the machine , <unk> running .
now , the engineers , you 're going to look at and say , `` no , that they do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can do that contribute , because if you very far cooling , they going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , can make those wires in the tension goodness .
in the connections , between about <unk> magnets in the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so hot , the wires are and <unk> <unk> away with a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all this is still a wonderful when you imagine , that the magnets about 20 tons weigh , to about . 30 inches shifted .
we were so about 50 percent of the magnets
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> it 's new , <unk> them .
they 're now all back on their way back .
against the end of the march is the lhc again <unk> .
we 're going to turn , and of the first data in june , or july , we 're going to , and put our journey continues to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , in a way to stir some of these accidents again , the debate about the value of the science and <unk> , such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , that reject .
i think the fact , it 's very difficult , the fact that we 're talking about our boundaries of the grasp , is perceived value of the things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my final element words , one english scientist contexts , humphrey <unk> , the , i suspect , as he 's the closet experiments his <unk> defended to be an apprentice was michael <unk> , this , `` nothing is dangerous for the evolution of human mind , when i assume that our scientific ideas on these are that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to conquer there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
and books to write is my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , into my love and fascination .
and i do n't expect that , that ever change is .
but it 's recent something weird in my life and my career on that gave me that has brought , i used to this work , to rethink .
this to what happened was that i recently wrote a book , to have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , i decided to different than all my previous books from that for some in the world beyond and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i want to do n't matter where i come , for me as if i want to the one of the <unk> .
seriously -- the height of the <unk> !
for instance , they come up very concerned , to me and say , if you are not that they do this success never review it be ?
you have no longer afraid of that they all their lives <unk> and never again a book , create that anybody in the world to know ? never again ? ''
okay , it 's really courage .
it , even worse , when i 'm not remember this was going to deliver , about 20 years , when i was a teenager the first time of them told me to a writer wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> always been faced am .
the people said , were you 're not afraid , never been to have ?
you ai n't afraid that you , the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you ai n't afraid you to this for a your life for <unk> and it never something which is , and that you 're on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes at the failure ? ''
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all those things .
and that i had always .
and i ago , a lot more things , that no <unk> dignity .
like this -- and other <unk> things .

it 's about ?
it 's obvious that by someone to be that he of it has , the work to do to the it , you get you feel ?
and what exactly the creative , there was going on that it 's not about the other <unk> making -- in a way , how it 's the other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can look at me not a situation in its 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the time he was asked , if he afraid to have , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how it 's hear you that ?
it was just not , you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group of a chemist , have over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we who seem , but these kinds of the reputation . but not just the writer , but the creative of genres , they seem like this call to have , mentally hugely unstable .
everything , what they need to do , is , the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the in the 20th century . at the young and a lot of their own hand died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , it seemed all of their talents really neglected had to be .
norman <unk> said , a moment ago , he died in his last job interview , <unk> my books , i was a little further <unk>
an extraordinary thing that you about her life can do .
but we shrug our not even , if we 've got someone like that you hear , because we all of these statements i 've been so long time you know , somehow we have the kind of this level , and the collective accepted that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always going to <unk> leads .
the question , what i want everyone here to ask me is : is this idea for them , in order ?
you feel , comfortable with ? because with only one inch by looking at -- i feel with a lot of all was not comfortable .
i think they become really .
and i think it 's dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , the next century , taken will .
i think it 's better , if we asked of creative encourage living .
and i know definitely that it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark straight in the hunch , <unk> -- especially in the fact , in the time i was in my career , i am .
this is -- you see , i 'm pretty well . i 'm only about , 40 years old .
i may still another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i went from now , going to write the world as the work , they will , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it comes straight , because we 're here , yes , all of friends -- it 's most likely to my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts , who wants to get to be able to nine o'clock in all , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work to do that i love .
so this is the question : how ?
eventually , the <unk> me like to come to continue to write a very pleased to sort of <unk> psychological construct design .
somehow i have to from now on a way to find the can write a safe distance , right between me and my very natural <unk> about what the response , that 's not going to be .
while i saw in the last year after models for looking to have to get to do this , i also in the past for and i tried to other societies have to find out to see , if you might have better or <unk> ideas about it did when we know how to creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal , with creativity to them .
this for led me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please follow me , because the circle will , back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people did n't believe that creativity of people , okay ?
they believed that creativity of <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , and unknown source to the people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown things .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that it 's believed , he had one <unk> , it , the wisdom from on the distance , which .
the roman had the same idea , which was that kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .
this is great . the roman did n't really that a genius , a very clever individual .
they believed that a genius with this magical divine , being was that we did was that 's literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- it 's about how <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work of invisible <unk> and the outcome of design would .
that 's brilliant -- there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological construct a , you look at the consequences of your work to protect .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist , the <unk> was a certain things are protected , like , for example , and much <unk> , right ?
if your work , it was were , and you do everything you look for you consult . everybody knew you to this <unk> genius did that you really helpful .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was something <unk> .
so we have the people in the west really long time about creativity , while .
and then the renaissance and all changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let 's the human individual into the center of the universe , imagine -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , for the unicorn creatures , the orders of divinity .
it 's the rational for business , and the people started to believe that creativity has completely from its own individual came .
the first time in the story , you can hear people , or those artist , a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i want to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a bare person to allow that he thinks , he or it was like this as the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , unknown , an mystery is a little tiny , too much responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psyche , even more .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
the suggestion there’s and so all our egos , and it 's all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that the <unk> our artists , the last 500 years , there are kind of mind .
and when it 's true , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
do we change ?
maybe to a we’ve understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can do that <unk> from 500 years of rational for business , not just in a <unk> lecture to eradicate .
and there 's certainly people in this audience , really fair scientific to register were about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc . how to work .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey can take away .
but the question , i left posing is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it as much sense of how do anything other that i heard of have , if it was never about that are absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> the creative process to understand .
a process , -- like everybody knows , it ever tried , something to make -- so in other words , actually , here -- not always as to behave .
in fact , it , sometimes literally <unk> feel .
i had recently that sort of what did when i took the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , the well over 90 is , but your entire life for poet . they told me that you when the <unk> virginia up out on the fields worked . they said , they would feel and to listen as a poem over the landscape on them <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
the over the country , they <unk> dignity .
they felt , if it came , because it was the earth under their feet , <unk> bring .
they knew that they asked in fact that moment , just one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil to the house while they 're coming from this poem that was being . it was only about that it fast enough to one of paper and a pencil reaches had to make it , if it through them <unk> to capture , and on the sheet , that could .
in other paint it was not fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they had reached the house , and the poem would weave through them and you missed it . they said it would keep talking about the country to come and -- how they said -- <unk> a different poet <unk> .
and then there 's these moments -- the part that i 'll never forget -- they said that 's moments , there was in which it 's almost missed .
so , it runs to the house and for the paper and the poem drives through them and they 're with a pin right when it through them <unk> and then -- i said , you -- it was so when i 'd love with their other hand , after them and it to get .
they miles the poem in its tail and moved to it back in your body , and it 's took on the kind of paper .
in these various came the poem do so , and intact on the paper on -- but it backwards -- the last word for the first .
when i think that i heard , i thought this is incredibly -- that 's exactly what kind of my creative process <unk>
this is actually ca n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to have , i have to every day , the same time to get up and sweat , i struggle and really awkward <unk> .
but even i held in <unk> have sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of you that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , from a source of me <unk> that i do n't really like one can .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step , so in the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but let 's the point , even in mental health to do ?
for me is the living for example of how to this is to be the musician tom <unk> . i had to him a few years for a magazine persons .

but then it became older and quiet . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in going to los angeles , . and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed , when he suddenly have a little patch of a melody hear that , how it in my inspirations often is , for him miserably hard is tangible . and he wants to have them . it 's gorgeous . he <unk> after , but he can you ca n't believe .
he 's not a piece of paper , he has n't a pen , he 's not sending .
he begins , this old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm coming from this song on forever to speak .
i 'm not good enough , i can do it ''
but rather than in order to panic into , he heard just stopped .
he ended up all the <unk> and i did something completely new .
he looked at just in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see that i know about that ? ''
<unk> i was so , when i could just a song down ?
if you really , they want to come to a <unk> at once again , when i 'm going to you care .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> , after that changed .
not the work itself . that was still often that dark matter how they said , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , it around , was salvaged when he 's kind of a genius , it took , where he 's nothing more than the trouble in the shape and it that sense , where he , came from . he realized that 's no skilled behavior , <unk> thing must be .
it was a component , miraculous , bizarre , working there , a conversation between tom , and the alien , <unk> thing that 's not very tom 's been .
when i do this story about what you have changed it a little bit of the way , i worked and it 's got me , even have saved .
this idea , and rescue me when i went through the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . i fell in one of dug the <unk> in that we all the fall , if we look at something to work and it does n't work . you <unk> , to think that 's a disaster . this is the worst book , that ever was written .
not only thing , but the worst , all time .
i started to think , i should pull this simple <unk> .
but then i remembered that , like tom in the free heaven , which had and i tried it .
i was so my view from our manuscript , and spoke to comment , an empty corner of the room .
i spoke out loud , `` stop , you thing , you and i know , both , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not completely my fault , is , right ?
because you see , that i do everything , what i , <unk> . i do n't even more than that .
if you get it so much we have you want to have to you here show up and your of the deal , all .
okay . but , if you do n't do -- you know what , to the devil with it .
i 'm and writing , because it 's my job .
and i want to , and give me to come today for my part of jobs here , scraping
because -- the end , it 's how to follow . centuries ago , have , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music around the long hours ceremony were -- the way to <unk> .
this fixed were always been great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but , again , very rare , was something special . one of the performer was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , even levels of performance , have seen .
it was as the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a kind of thus step . he did n't do something different than he 's ever before has done -- 1,000 nights earlier . but all the added , together .
and very suddenly appeared , he did n't even more than any longer in human .
he was from up and from the bottom up and everything lit , through a divine , fire .
as something that at that happened to know the people that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
the interesting historic footnote : when the <unk> <unk> cetaceans they brought this practice , with . the way it changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still in <unk> and <unk> sounds .
if a performer in spain , something <unk> , something magical has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> more , there is it , a glimpse at the god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part is the next morning , if the dancer ourselves up and realize that 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday is -- and he does no longer a <unk> from god in , and is .
he is merely a aging mortal with <unk> at . and maybe he will never come back to these heights level-up .
and maybe will never again , god 's name out , when he said , about . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> done some of creative life .
but maybe it does not very , so many of anguish , if you in the first , we did n't have to the most aspects of being , of you move it .
if you might just think that you a loaner are -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> at your life that , somebody else , down is , if you 've done it .
if we start , so think about , it changes that everything .
so i started to think , and so i think , certainly in the past few months , while i 'm going to the book working , that soon be going -- as the most dangerous , appetite , strong expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always even need to say , when i think about you , let me , is : i did n't afraid .
do n't be feeling disheartened .
just do your job .
she was going to continue for your contribution there , and he may be .
when your job that dance is , i 'm dancing .
if the dumb divine genius , that you to the side , which is to decide , for a moment , and yet from miracles through your effort to show , then <unk> ! ''
and if not , i 'm dancing and yet , your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all this .
i believe it . and i feel that we should be the teaching .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all this , just for you to the mere human love and the <unk> have said , that they measure .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides just shown to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , for some way , three million years of the size of the bottom 48 states had to 40 percent shrunk .
but that there 's not be strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of the ice shows .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide that i 'm going to show that 's a <unk> , which in the last 25 years happened .
that <unk> , it 's labeled .
as you see , it 's on the blue is to something . this is the annual ice in the wintertime ; and it -- in summer .
that 's called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which of the body 's <unk> .
in 25 years , it from here , here 's gone .
this is a problem , because the warming , frozen for the arctic ocean <unk> , in that 's very large amounts of <unk> carbon , there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes and methane , which is .
compared with the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this will double , if we have this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in a flat lakes in alaska , methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska , of another task force to a different was lake last winter , across .
wow !
she 's good . the question is , how it 's running through .
and a reason is , this enormous heat up with the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume are much larger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know what the sea through <unk> up here <unk> them into the ocean .
those rivers , rapid pace .
the other end of the planet , the antarctica , the biggest ice on the planet .
last month volunteered researchers in the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , about a couple <unk> up is , is very strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet above sea level , greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> ice , you see the top of lakes , a few years glaciers were .
40 percent of people on the world to get the half of their <unk> from this draining .
in the andes is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the as well have , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in <unk> the sierra seen .
this story on the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read have , are seriously .
these <unk> in the world to a dramatic increase , fire .
and the disaster in the world have in a really <unk> and she 'd never unprecedented degree gained .
four times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 percent .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of yourself , you can see , what 's <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced , all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
you look , the area of the eastern pacific right , the american continent west , and both the indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of oxygen in the ocean , there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , next to logging , which is 20 percent , which is the burning of fossil fuels .
it 's a problem , and coal is that , but nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one or the largest <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change to see .
here are the , in recent years , painted by , with some green alternatives , and proposed by .
<unk> there 's a political engagement in in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to apply that , a contradiction in , is .
this reminded me of something .
the christmas around them off , with me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our whole country in the <unk> can america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads , the <unk> the christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy -- what does .
it 's in a skin and wealth in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he 's affordable , and <unk> , and the workers stay in traditional account and bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in the west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the director of massey coal .
let me tell you a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry comic , they do n't know , what they 're talking about .
so , the alliance for <unk> two campaigns to sleep in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious threat to our business .
so we have it 's the top <unk> posed , a significant <unk> spending to a <unk> on the way to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , it 's clean -- and it smells , it , a good .
so , to do n't worry about the climate .
let them the quiet us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about it .
so let it 's a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal of the main reasons for the global warming is that 's remarkable clean <unk> , you see here , changes everything .
you look , it right , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally grew up , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a bold , new solution to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america , 100 percent cleaner electricity in new , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to get to us safer to try and to help , the global warming continues to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , we have to solve problems .
<unk> across the new . they get more out .
this is the last thing .
here 's the one <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of the old , dirty diapers <unk> , the world is this one , to reduce .
the future is here . the wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investment , well , from well-paid jobs of law .
<unk> across the new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african saying : `` if you be fast you want to go alone .
if you very far from where you want to go together . ''
we need to go far come , which is very quickly .
thank you .
i want to begin with them to ask , the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized how to the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , we learned when they actually , to think about , and problems through the understanding and change the spatial across to solve .
the spatial thinking is so closely connected , how we have a lot of our environment to understand .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to be wondering : what would be , if we use computers were , instead of <unk> , as a digital <unk> on a flat tie moves -- what would be , if we do with both hands intervene could and data , physically , who and they so the way we could , how we want ?
this question was so really , that we need to the answer is going on and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is a more interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can do with the hand moves , you can , each other as well , you can put them to capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
so much more importantly , are physically , why you like blocks merely by the stick out of hands and accessing can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a conscious for them to develop , each of body and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we can start with the study of new and <unk> <unk> begin .
i 'll start with some simple example .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , the video forward , played ; if i asked him in the other <unk> , and it backwards .
and this interactive portraits , it becomes true .
if i want you so next horribly , and that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , notice it 's also , and you can think about .
and they feel as their movements and the slope .
an interesting a result of interactions , we 're going to see it started , was that we keep everyday gestures on the data to be , as color is supposed to them into how to this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> than <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the in the center to pour , then mix up .
if we do it carried , we can get a little <unk> .
there 's also , some nice opportunities in education , how many languages , and mathematics , or <unk> , where we people the possibility of the rapid trial and give the right to see .
i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers that i do with a simple <unk> literally .
this is a game with words , this one of the kind of <unk> and <unk> .
basically , you get any round , every <unk> random <unk> letters and while you 're trying to see words to form , this talk about a dictionary through .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids , is a trip to the media lab came out . i could you to move , it to try and have a video of them .
they have it really loved .
a more interesting fact , of applications that is that you to the people not many instructions , there must .
everything else you need to say is `` you 'll say , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people that 's going to test .
this is our recent <unk> down there , right .
and it turned out , he said to the <unk> just a pile i want .
so for him , they were just blocks .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a my own for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene bring , by and he <unk> out of the insist on , this figure shows .
here it 's the sun at work .
the sun goes on
now i 've got it 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah !
and he 's the <unk> shake and them , put it could , the characters are so ...
i brought his own story ourselves .
hi !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how do these illnesses .
flying cat .
the last example , for that 's what i have time , to have , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that recently we 've developed and in the <unk> as a wide , like <unk> , singing and drums operate .
every has four different variations ; you can choose , which you to use .
and you can this sounds in the sequence -- that you again in any of them .
and you <unk> them , by showing you just a <unk> to a <unk> holding .
there are effects that you live , we can change , like . hall and filters .
you connect him with a particular sound , and one from him and then to hire .
and then , the overarching effects , like the speed and the volume , you on the entire sequence gets .
so we 're watching time .
we start , in the way that we <unk> in two <unk> -- and this in a series of them , you expand and a little bit more about the voice to add .
now in -- i have a bass , it .
now i 'm still a little drums .
and now , up to the filter with the drums , to the effect of live in it .
i can all the sequence speed , and i was the rate in the one or other direction <unk> .
and now , up to the filter , with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can see the sequence , while they 're going on <unk> .
so i have to you 're not in the reservations are planning , but you truly improvising ; they meanwhile extend or up .
and finally , i can all the sequence <unk> , by , i <unk> after the left tend to .
thank you .
so as you can see , is my desire to it , new <unk> to develop the better to fit , like our brains and bodies to work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of going to what we 're in our lab to work .
the idea , i want them with the true to leave , is that we 're looking at the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world to bring that our needs to .
thank you ,
i 'm on the conversations with you all .
